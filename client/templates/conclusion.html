                        <p>I§1. This book provides a collection of over five hundred similes from thirty-five Dialogues of Plato. This kind of investigation has never been done for this author or, I believe, for any other prose author from classical antiquity, in contrast to numerous studies of similes in Homer and Vergil. These reveal an important aspect of Plato’s literary artistry, especially in his portrayal of Socrates’ humorous and inquisitive personality, but also in the presentation of many other topics explored in the Dialogues. Furthermore, since Aristotle said that similes are not usually found in prose authors, it is very interesting to find so many; we have also tried to explain this apparent contradiction.</p>
                        <p>I§2. The new definition presented in this study brings greater simplicity and precision to the discussion of metaphors and similes. Instead of the proliferation of terms and subtle distinctions that have arisen, we have proposed three main categories (Introduction C-6): conventional (where a <i>prothesis</i>, usually ‘like’ or ‘as’, is expressed), alternative (where numerous other expressions state the comparison) and implicit (where ‘as’ or ‘like’ is implied) with a very minor category which I have called ‘denominative’ (where the vehicles are expressed as verbs, adjectives or adverbs). Thus we find that many more words and phrases introduce similes than the few words traditionally associated with them (<i>as</i>, <i>like</i>, <i>than</i>). The modern terms <i>tenor</i> and <i>vehicle</i> were not known in antiquity and they have played an important role in formulating my distinction between <i>simile</i> and <i>metaphor</i>, which leaves intact Aristotle’s concept of <i>metaphor</i> as language borrowed from one circumstance and applied to another. See Introduction C sections 5-7 for a detailed discussion.</p>
                        <p>I§3. This study raises some new questions in the area of literary criticism as applied to Plato, but also to other authors. Why do prose authors use similes? What effect do they have on their compositions?  What if they were omitted? How should we distinguish accurately between similes and other figures of speech? This Compendium, with its ancillary charts and appendices, provides a beginning to the answers of such questions.</p>
                        <h3>A. Distinguishing between similes, comparisons and metaphors</h3>
                        <p>I§4. Judgment is required in distinguishing some similes from simple comparisons, as may be seen from the example at <i>Hippias Minor</i> 365d, where the vehicle is simply literal, not figurative: “Homer made <i>Achilles</i> <b>better than <i>Odysseus</i></b>.” Also, of course, not every predicate statement is a simile (e.g., when it is a definition: “a carnivore is a meat-eating animal”). If the word ‘like’ can be inserted without changing the meaning significantly (in a figurative expression), the expression may be considered a simile: Homer said that Agamemnon was [like] a ‘shepherd of the people.’<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-1">1</a>]<a id="noteref_n-1"></a> </span> Furthermore, the context will show whether a word or expression is intended metaphorically. The statement “I’ve been down this road before” could be literal or metaphorical, whereas “he entered the <i>evening</i> of his life with no illusions” is a metaphor since the ‘tenor’ is not expressed and the reader is expected to understand the code that substitutes <i>evening</i> for <i>last years</i>. Conversely, “old age is <b>like</b> the evening of life” is a simile since the comparison is made explicit with both <i>tenor</i> (old age) and <i>vehicle</i> (the evening of life) expressed—although the vehicle itself is a metaphor.  See Introduction C-8 for further discussion.</p>
                        <h3>B. Metaphors as vehicles of a simile in poetic language</h3>
                        <p>I§5. It sometimes happens in very poetic or lyrical language that the vehicle of a simile is itself a metaphor, as in Oscar Hammerstein’s lyrics to Jerome Kern’s song ‘All the Things You Are’: <i>You</i> (tenor) are the <b><i>promised kiss of springtime</i></b> (vehicle) That makes the lonely winter seem long. <i>You</i> are the <b><i>breathless hush of evening</i></b> That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.</p>
                        <p>I§6. Here the metaphor is reminiscent of Plato’s phrase ‘unripe fruit of laughter’ [<i>Republic</i> 5.3: 457b], an allusion to a phrase from Pindar applied to young men who laugh when they see the women exercising nude. Since the (vehicular) <i>tenors</i> for <i>kiss </i>and<i> hush</i> are missing, these phrases may be classed as metaphors. But this form is highly poetic and rare in Plato’s Dialogues since the normal purpose of his similes is to make his message clearer, not more poetic. Michael Silk <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-2">2</a>]<a id="noteref_n-2"></a> </span> discusses an interesting example in Heraclitus (22B 52 DK) where, rather than saying ‘Life is random’, the philosopher uses a picturesque metaphor, ‘Life is a boy playing <i>pessoi</i> (‘backgammon’: <i>aiôn paîs esti paizôn pesseuôn</i>). Although Silk calls this expression a metaphor, it seems to me to illustrate more precisely a predicate (implicit) simile since the omission of the word ‘like’ hardly changes the sense and both tenor (‘life’) and vehicle (the <i>pessos</i>-playing <i>puer</i>) are expressed.</p>
                        <h3>C. Other figures of speech analogous to similes</h3>
                        <p>I§7. As may be seen in Appendix III, several other figures of speech are analogous to similes: <i>allegories</i>, <i>analogies</i>, <i>paradoxes</i>, <i>proverbs</i>, <i>puns</i>, <i>historical</i>, and <i>mythical</i> <i>parallels</i>. Plato’s speakers, primarily Socrates, use all of these philological tools to add support to an argument by exploiting similarities that are sometimes surprising, paradoxical or humorous. For one example, consider the statement at <i>Republic</i> 7.514a [<i>Republic</i> 7.1]: “<b>Imagine</b> [<b>an allegory of</b> ] (<i>apeikason</i>) <i>our</i> <i>nature</i> with regard to education and ignorance. Now <b>picture</b> humans <b>as</b> in an underground cave-like dwelling.” Socrates’ famous story that unfolds is an elaborate description of the human condition (an allegory) introduced by a comparison of human ignorance to people living in a cave (a simile).</p>
                        <h3>D.   Importance of examining the Greek in similes</h3>
                        <p>I§8. In light of what has been said in the Introduction (especially C.7), one cannot assume that, if the word <i>simile</i> is used in a translation, it reflects a special word in Greek. Sometimes the English version would make a reader think there is a simile in the Greek: at <i>Lysis</i> 205a the text has only two verbs (‘he raves’ and ‘he is mad’:<i> alla lêrei te kai mainetai</i>), whereas one translation exclaims, “Why, he raves <i>like</i> a madman!” <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-3">3</a>]<a id="noteref_n-3"></a> </span> G. M. A. Grube also adds a simile to his translation of a passage from the <i>Republic</i> 2 (365a): “young men who are able to collect from the various opinions as though flying over them <i>like a bee flitting from flower to flower gathering honey</i>” (Plato <i>Republic</i> [Hackett 1974] 36; the Greek text has only <i>hôsper epiptomenoi</i> without the bee reference). Another example, from Plato’s <i>Statesman</i> (297e), imposes the word <i>simile</i> on the Greek: “Let us make a <i>simile</i> of them (<i>schema</i>) and use it to help us to discover something.” (The Visitor) “What is your <i>simile</i> (<i>Poion ti</i>)?” (Young Socrates).<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-4">4</a>]<a id="noteref_n-4"></a> </span> Thus it is essential to examine these statements in the original language.</p>
                        <h3>E. Variety of similetic constructions in <i>Timaeus</i></h3>
                        <p>I§9. The <i>Timaeus</i> illustrates the v<b>ariety of similetic constructions</b> and expressions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a <i>heavenly flood </i>comes borne along <b>like</b> a <b><i>plague</i></b> [<i>Timaeus</i> 2: 23a–b];</li>
                            <li>your <i>genealogies</i> which you related just now, O Solon <b>differ</b> little from <b><i>children’s stories</i></b>.” [<i>Timaeus</i> 4: 23b];</li>
                            <li>he [the father of the universe] divided the <i>souls</i> [to make them] <b>equal to</b> the <b><i>stars</i></b> in number – and mounting [each on a <i>star</i>] <b>as</b> <b><i>on a chariot</i></b>. [<i>Timaeus</i> 6: 41d–e];</li>
                            <li>The two divine revolutions … they bound within a <b><i>sphere</i></b>&#8211;<i>shaped</i> body.” [<i>Timaeus</i> 7: 44d];</li>
                            <li>They implanted the form of the <i>lung</i>(<i>s</i>) … having within it cavities <b>like</b> a <b><i>sponge</i></b> (70c)—and they placed <i>it</i> [<i>the lung</i>(<i>s</i>)] around the heart <b>as</b> <b><i>a kind of padding</i></b>. [<i>Timaeus</i> 12a–b: 70d];</li>
                            <li>“The superior powers as nourishment for us lesser beings provided fluid for our bodies by cutting [<i>veins</i>] <b>like</b> <b><i>channels in gardens</i></b>, so that [each body] might receive <i>moisture</i><b> just as</b> <b><i>from a spring</i></b> coming to it.” [<i>Timaeus</i> 21: 77c]</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>F.  Multiplicity of vivid similes in <i>Phaedrus</i></h3>
                        <p>I§10. In the <i>Phaedrus</i> at the climax of Socrates’ palinode on love a <b>stream of vivid similes</b> is introduced (sections 252–256): the beloved is compared to a god; desire to a stream, a wind, an echo; the lover is like one who has caught an eye disease (<i>hoion ap’ allou ophthalmias</i>) from someone and cannot explain it, but he starts to see himself in his beloved’s eyes as in a mirror (<i>hôsper d’en katoptrôi</i>). The <b>multiplicity of similes</b> continues with the <i>logos</i> compared to a current of water that must be swum through (264a), to a living being (<i>hôsper zoion</i> at 264c), and to a peculiar inscription (‘in no way differing from’, <i>ouden diapherei</i>, at 264d) that is written in such a way that it makes no difference how the verses are arranged.</p>
                        <h3>G.  Stylistic tendencies in the placement of similes</h3>
                        <p>I§11. Some stylistic tendencies may be observed. For example, Plato sometimes placed similes near the beginning or conclusion of a Dialogue, as in <i>Alcibiades</i> 1 (at the end of a long Dialogue; also in the <i>Philebus</i>); in <i>Alcibiades</i> 2 there is a simile at the beginning and at the end (as in the <i>Cratylus</i>); in the <i>Critias</i> a simile is in the first sentence and in the <i>Republic</i> in the last sentence.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-5">5</a>]<a id="noteref_n-5"></a> </span> In Chart C one can see that often similes occur in clusters, as when Socrates adduces a variety of images for the soul [<i>Phaedo</i> 2–9] as someone inebriated, a prisoner, a kind of harmony, a weaver, a disease; or when he discusses the cave [<i>Republic</i> 7.1–6], democratic government [<i>Republic</i> 8.8–11], or the myth of Er [<i>Republic</i> 10.9–13]; or when Aristophanes is narrating his myth [<i>Symposium</i> 4.11]; or when Timaeus is describing the structure of the body [<i>Timaeus</i> 10–36]. <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-6">6</a>]<a id="noteref_n-6"></a> </span> In the <i>Euthydemus</i> similes serve to mark off sections of a Dialogue. <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-7">7</a>]<a id="noteref_n-7"></a> </span> Thus by their placement similes contribute not only to clarifying the argument but also to enhancing the literary and dramatic presentation of the Dialogues.</p>
                        <p>I§12. Another use of similes not previously mentioned is as conversational indicators at various points in the argument, e.g. when Timaeus tells Socrates [<i>Critias</i> 1] that he is happy to be free from “the <i>journey of our conversation</i> … <b>as though</b> <b><i>resting from a long trip</i></b>;” or when Glaucon asks Socrates for more details about the nature of dialectic (<i>Republic</i> 7: 532e), for these would bring us to the place where we can rest <i>on the road</i> so to speak (<i>hôsper hodou anapaula an eiê</i>) and then come to the end of our journey (<i>kai telos tês poreias</i>).” Other similes applied to the conversation underway may be found at [<i>Hipparchus</i> 1] (the conversation is a game in which Socrates will return things said), [<i>Laws</i> 7-12] (it is like a poem), [<i>Laws</i> 10 -1] (it is like a swift river), [<i>Philebus</i> 1] (it is like a story), [<i>Republic</i> 3-1] (it is like the wind), [<i>Republic</i> 8-2] (like a wrestling match), [<i>Sophist</i> 8] (a feast for the young). The participants are compared to hounds [<i>Laws</i> 2-1] a man at a cross-roads [<i>Laws</i> 7-7], bricklayers [<i>Laws</i> 9-3], athletes [<i>Philebus</i> 6], a rooster that leaps up and starts to crow before winning the argument [<i>Theaetetus</i> 6]. Further examples may be found at [<i>Alcibiades</i> 1-1, <i>Apology</i> 1, <i>Euthydemus</i> 1 through 5, <i>Laws</i> 3-2, <i>Laws</i> 10-2, <i>Lysis</i> 1 through 5, <i>Parmenides</i> 1 and 5, <i>Protagorus</i> 10, 13, 14, and 21; <i>Republic</i> 1-6, <i>Republic</i> 2-2, <i>Republic</i> 3-1, <i>Statesman</i> 4 and 8, <i>Theaetetus</i> 15].</p>
                        <p>I§13. These examples suggest that Plato used similes both as rhetorical adornments as well as markers of the progress of the argument in his Dialogues. One may also note the stylistic variation whereby some introductory words are found in certain Dialogues more frequently than in others, such as <i>kathaper</i> in the <i>Laws</i> and <i>hoion</i> in <i>Timaeus</i>. Perhaps Plato imitated stylistic tendencies of certain speakers or his style changed over time. It would seem that the only places where Plato did <i>not</i> use similes were complex philosophical or technical discussions (e.g. <i>Laws</i> Books 6, 8, and 11; see comment at [<i>Parmenides</i> 6]). They may also be found occasionally in his letters. <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-8">8</a>]<a id="noteref_n-8"></a> </span></p>
                        <h3>H. Observations based on Charts D and F</h3>
                        <p>I§14. Chart D:  Most of the starred ‘inauthentic’ Dialogues are shorter (except for <i>Alcibiades</i>I and <i>Epinomis</i>) and have fewer similes.  There does not seem to be any close correlation between the length of the Dialogues and the number of similes detected.  Not surprisingly those with the most similes are among the thirteen longest Dialogues (over 17, 000 words):  <i>Republic</i> (127), <i>Laws</i> (66), <i>Timaeus</i>(36), <i>Phaedrus</i> (31), <i>Theaetetus</i> (23), <i>Symposium</i> (16) and <i>Protagoras</i> (21).  And yet some of the shorter Dialogues (<i>Lysis, Alcibiades</i> II and <i>Cleitophon</i>) contain relatively more similes.  The presence of these figures of speech apparently has more to do with the subject matter (and Plato’s artistic concerns) than with any other factor.  Hence the dearth of them in a funeral oration (<i>Menexenus</i>) merits our attention.  And some longer works, like the <i>Cratylus, Philebus</i> or <i>Sophist</i>, do not seem to have as many of these figures as might be expected.  In terms of numbers, we may note that the books of the <em>Iliad</em> also vary greatly in similes:  nine books have 2-10 similes; ten have 11-20; five have 21-30 (figures based on tallies in List A of Lee, 50-58). This probably is related to the action of the plot, with more similes introduced when there is battle movement or other such activity that requires vivid description.</p>
                        <p>I§15. Chart F:  These numbers tally with the totals (added in the last column) for each Dialogue—with small variations because some similes are counted separately in Charts E and F but as subdivisions of the same simile in Chart A (e.g. <i>Statesman</i> 9, a and b).  <i>Epinomis</i> and <i>Theages</i> have been omitted.  What stands out?  1-The stylistic preference for the ‘<i>hoîos’</i> series and <i>kathaper</i> over <i>hôsper</i> in the <i>Laws</i> and <i>Timaeus</i>.  2-The preference for <i>hôsper</i> in the other Dialogues, especially <i>Euthydemus, Gorgias, Phaedo, Protagoras, Symposium </i>and <i>Theaetetus</i>.  <i>Phaedrus, Republic</i> and <i>Statesman</i> are more balanced, although <i>hôsper</i> is the primary <i>prothesis.</i></p>
                        <h3>I.  Plato’s philosophy as substance + imagery, style, similes</h3>
                        <p>I§16. In an interesting passage of the <i>Gorgias</i> (502c) Socrates develops the argument that poetry stripped of its ‘music’ is simple rhetoric, therefore a kind of public speaking or ‘flattery’ (<i>kolakeîa</i>): “If we strip (<i>tis perieloi</i>) any kind of poetry of its melody, rhythm and metre (<i>to te melos kai ton rhythmon kai to metron</i>), we get mere speeches as the residue (<i>allo ti ê logoi gignontai to leipomenon</i>), do we not?” It is tempting to propose here an analogy with the artistry of Plato’s Dialogues. If we strip his Dialogues of all dramatic and rhetorical aspects, including similes, would we have then ‘mere’ philosophy? Some readers prefer to do this and read them as though they were philosophical texts, although fortunately Plato did not choose this method. Perhaps this is why Plato denied, if the seventh letter is genuine, ever having set down his philosophical views in writing. By this analogy [poetry &gt; rhetoric = literary aspects of Dialogues &gt; philosophy] the philosophical residue that would be left would appear quite different from what we are accustomed to think of as Platonic or Socratic. It is difficult to imagine the substance of most of Plato’s Dialogues without the imagery, without the literary style, without the similes.</p>
                        <h3>J.   Collection of 500 similes:  Some final observations on numbers</h3>
                        <p>I§17. A collection of more than five hundred similes has formed the basis of this study, a number sufficient to identify a few trends, some of which have already been noted. The Dialogues which have the <i>most similes</i> are the <i>Republic</i> (127), <i>Laws</i> (66), <i>Timaeus</i> (36); whereas the fewest similes are found in the <i>Epinomis</i> (0), <i>Theages</i> (0), <i>Hipparchus</i> (1), <i>Lovers</i> (1), <i>Menexenus</i> (1), <i>Minos</i> (1)—several of which are considered spurious. Similes are found more often in the conversational parts of the Dialogues than in the narrative sections except when Socrates is the narrator (e.g. in the <i>Charmides</i>, <i>Euthydemus</i>, <i>Lovers</i>, <i>Lysis</i>, <i>Protagoras</i>, and <i>Republic</i>; others narrate the <i>Parmenides</i>, <i>Phaedo</i>, and <i>Symposium</i>)—again suggesting that similes were characteristic of Socrates’ (philosimelitic) style of speaking. The number of conventional similes is 365, of alternative 82, implicit 57, and denominative 10 (see Chart E). In most Dialogues approximately half the similes are about the subject under discussion; the other half consist of comparisons with the discourse itself, the participants (especially Socrates), and incidental remarks.</p>
                        <h2>II. Socrates in Similes</h2>
                        <p>II§1. What do we learn about Socrates from Plato’s similes? As some Dialogues show Socrates in action (e.g. the nine ‘theatrical’ Dialogues [Chart D]), Plato’s similes reveal more the inner man: his methods of argumentation, persuasion, and allusion. Socrates is the speaker of 300 (60 percent of the total of 500) of these similes; he is the dominant speaker of similes (84 percent) in the Dialogues in which he is a participant—and in addition sometimes the similes spoken by others are about Socrates. (Chart B)</p>
                        <p>II§2. Socrates is the only speaker of similes in twelve Dialogues (<i>Apology, Charmides, Crito, Euthyphro, Hipparchus, Hippias Major, Ion, Lovers, Lysis, Menexenus, Minos, Phaedrus)</i> as well as in five books of the <i>Republic</i> (Bks 3, 4, 7, 9, 10).  He also provides most of the similes in other Dialogues (<i>Alcibiades 1, Alcibiades 2, Cratylus, Euthydemus, Gorgias, Meno, Phaedo, Philebus, Protagoras</i>, the other books of the <i>Republic</i> and <i>Theaetetus</i>. Thus his total number (ca. 300) makes 60% of similes included in this study (ca. 500).  There are no Socratic similes in <i>Cleitophon, Critias, Laws, Sophist</i>, and only one (each) in the <i>Statesman</i> (Younger Socrates) and <i>Timaeus</i>.  If we subtract from the total (500) the similes (141) in two Dialogues where Socrates is absent (sixty-six in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Laws</span>, thirteen in <i>Sophist</i>,), or his speaking part is limited (five in <i>Cleitophon</i>, twenty-one in the <i>Statesman</i> and thirty-six in <i>Timaeus</i><span style="text-decoration: underline">),</span> then the percentage attributed to Socrates is even higher (359/500 = 84%).  This underscores the degree to which the use of similes appears to be characteristic of Socrates.</p>
                        <p>II§3. How does he appear from this perspective? He is shown to be humorous, modest, and prolific in his references to contemporary social mores and literary allusions. Similes are particularly interesting for the vivid illustrations and imagery introduced to persuade his interlocutors of the correctness of his argument. They also provide a wide range of images as part of his portrait, some of them perhaps difficult to reconcile. <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-9">9</a>]<a id="noteref_n-9"></a> </span> On the other hand, some activities and aspects of his life mentioned in the <i>Apology</i> and other Dialogues are not reflected in the similes: his examination of leading citizens about <i>sophia</i> (in keeping with the oracle’s reply to Chaerephon’s question, “Who is wiser than Socrates?”), his poverty, his courage in refusing to go along with illegal actions after the battle of Arginusae (406 BCE), and with the arrest of Leon during the rule of the Thirty (403–402 BCE).</p>
                        <p>II§4. From the long list of similes in the Compendium, we have distinguished four groups (Appendix I-B) involving Socrates. The first group consists of 30 similes offered by Socrates about himself, in which he compares himself to various animals (stork, gadfly, fawn, fish, bee, a hungry animal), human types (shadow-boxer, Corybant, doctor, game-player, hunter, lawyer, prophet, doorkeeper, boxer, physician, glutton), and mythical figures (Herakles, a beast like Typhon).</p>
                        <p>II§5. In twenty-one similes Socrates refers to himself as part of a group—of humans and animals: e.g. we are like the suitors in the Odyssey, athletes, wine-pourers, children chasing larks, slaves or sheep, oysters, a rooster that crows too soon, ants or frogs around a marsh. Almost all of these are humorous exaggerations, meant to portray Socrates in a self-effacing light but not disparaging or mocking others.</p>
                        <p>II§6. In a third group, similes (20) are expressed by other speakers in the Dialogues about Socrates, of which the most memorable are Meno’s comparison of Socrates to a sting-ray, Glaucon’s calling him a snake-charmer, Zeno’s charge that he is like a Lacanian hound, and Alcibiades’ description of his appearance like a Silenus, specifically the satyr Marsyas. These are humorous depictions, but others allude to his effect on people: he wakes us up, leads us to virtue, utters oracles like an inspired prophet, is like a father to us. A few are critical: Socrates is seen as a poor steersman, a player of childish games, a pig in his behavior. This variety is due to the circumstances of the Dialogues. (In the Socratic Dialogues the other speakers tend to direct their similes to or about Socrates. In the non-Socratic Dialogues the similes are very much like those Socrates uses in the Socratic Dialogues. That is to say, except for perhaps the lack of humor, the similes of the <i>Laws</i>, the <i>Sophist</i>, or <i>Statesman</i> seem as ‘Socratic’ as those in the Socratic Dialogues.)</p>
                        <p>II§.7 In another group (27) Socrates introduces similes in order to make observations about other people and things. The subjects (<i>tenors</i>) of these similes are as varied as the vehicles are imaginative: death as metamorphosis, a contemptuous characterization of Callicles’ view of life, a belittling image of Meletus as a crybaby, his philosophic friends as pregnant women, knowledge as wild birds caught and placed in an aviary in our soul, the Lacedaimonians as old women who tell stories, an imperfect theory as a leaky pot, the laws of Athens as flutes that enchant the Corybants, a good lover as a hunter who does not scare away his prey, Thrasymachus as a bath-man, democracy as a beautiful robe, Charmides as a statue or an actor, Pericles’ children as sacred cattle, and especially the unforgettable bad philosophers who are like a little bald copper smith, freed from his bonds and now ready to marry his master’s daughter! There is no particular theme in these comparisons except that they are characterized by humor and sympathy for most of his subjects (excluding Meletus and bad philosophers). Most of the similes in <i>Euthydemus</i>, for example, are humorous, comparing the young men and their companions to a chorus following their leader (Euthydemus), the argument to a ball and wrestling, Socrates and other listeners to children chasing larks, or people fallen into a labyrinth, and Socrates himself to a fish caught in a net. Subjects that appear more than once include arguments, knowledge, opinions, ideas, philosophy, democracy, love, the soul, and death. Also Socrates uses the image of Daedalus three times: in reference to Euthyphro’s statements as hard to pin down as the works of Daedalus (<i>Euthydemus</i> 3), claiming Daedalus’ works would be considered ridiculous today (<i>Hippias Major</i> 1), and comparing his works to a runaway slave (<i>Meno</i> 4). Thus, according to Plato, Socrates was clearly philo- and poly-similetic—a true lover of similes. <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-10">10</a>]<a id="noteref_n-10"></a> </span> Although he sometimes makes literary references, they are not obscure; e.g. Socrates’ similes are the only ones that refer to Homer [<i>Alcibiades</i> 2-4, <i>Ion</i> 1, <i>Lovers</i> 1, <i>Philebus</i> 7, <i>Republic</i> 1-5, <i>Republic</i> 8-4]—except in the <i>Hippias Minor</i> which involves a discussion of Homer (e.g. [<i>Hippias Minor</i> 1], where Hippias quotes Achilles in the <i>Iliad</i>). They are primarily instructive rather than elaborative or descriptive. Humor is noticeably lacking in most of the similes attributed to others in comparison with these four groups associated with Socrates.</p>
                        <p>II§8. Thus the number and variety of similes contribute to the portrayal of Socrates. One might add that none of this delightful literary embellishment would have existed if Plato had written philosophical essays instead of dialogues.  Observations about a selection of other subjects found in similes may be found in Appendices I and II.</p>
                        <h2>III. Why Similes?</h2>
                        <p>III§1. Why do prose writers use similes? Quoting some non-Platonic examples we may say that two common reasons are to clarify abstract or religious concepts and to make distinctions between synonyms. For example, “The <i>kingdom of heaven</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>mustard seed planted in a field</i></b>” (Matthew 13:31) or “… <b>like</b> a <b><i>treasure</i></b> <b><i>hidden in a field</i></b>” (Matthew 13:44). The tenor is abstract and the vehicle is concrete. To distinguish between ‘talent’ and ‘genius’, Arthur Schopenhauer observed that “<i>talent</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>marksman who hits a target the others cannot reach</i></b>; <i>genius</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>marksman who hits a target the others cannot even see</i></b>.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-11">11</a>]<a id="noteref_n-11"></a> </span> These similes clarify the distinction between synonyms. Other reasons are to assist in the description of sounds, sights and feelings (“it sounded <b>like</b> a <b><i>thunderbolt</i></b>”); to add an appropriate literary parallel (“<b>like</b> the <b><i>serpent in the Garden of Eden</i></b>”); or to add humor, often by exaggeration (“a <i>woman</i> needs a man <b>like</b> a <b><i>fish</i></b> needs a bicycle”).</p>
                        <p>III§2. Presumably there is something innately satisfying about creating similes, but in addition Plato suggests in various Dialogues why he includes them. At <i>Gorgias</i> 517d Socrates says to Callicles that he purposefully (<i>exepitêdes</i>) uses the same illustrations (<i>tôn autôn eikonôn</i>) <b>to make a point easier to grasp</b> (<i>hina rhâion katamathêis</i>). Although he may not be referring to similes specifically, they would fall under the same category of assisting understanding. <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-12">12</a>]<a id="noteref_n-12"></a> </span></p>
                        <p>III§3. Another reason is suggested at [<i>Laws</i> 10-2]: “Let us not make our answer by <b><i>looking directly, as it were (hoîon), at the sun</i></b>, bringing on night at midday, as though (<i>hôs</i>) <i>looking at reason</i> (<i>noûn</i>) <i>with mortal eyes</i> we could ever (<i>pote</i>) know it sufficiently; … <b>looking at an image (<i>eikona</i>) of the question being asked is a safer way to see</b>” (897d). Here the Athenian Visitor suggests that <b>some topics are easier to understand if you look at them indirectly</b> (i.e. in a different context).</p>
                        <p>III§4. At [<i>Phaedrus</i> 6] Socrates chooses a simile to avoid a long digression: “Concerning the soul’s form this much may be said. To tell what it really is would require a long discourse, but it is within human power to describe it briefly in a figure (hôi<i> de eoiken</i>).” Thus a good simile substitutes for a lengthy analysis (a picture worth a thousand words). He cannot tell briefly what something is, so he chooses to say what it is like.  (We have referred earlier, at [Republic 4-5], to Shorey’s note that “the elaboration of the image here is . . . partly to relieve the monotony of continuous argument.”)</p>
                        <p>III§5. At [<i>Republic</i> 7-13] we have noted Socrates’ acknowledgment (533a) that similes somehow capture the truth about some things that cannot be stated exactly: “If I could, I would show you no longer an image or symbol (<i>eikona</i>), as it appears to me, of my meaning, but the very truth (<i>auto to alêthes</i>).” This aspect of similes is discussed briefly in Shorey’s note (d) to <i>Republic</i> 6.489a5 in respect to putting the comparison “to the proof”: “Plato like some modern writers is conscious of his own imagery and frequently interprets his own symbols.” Cf. 517a–b, 531b, p. 40 etc. Cf. also “the cases where he says <i>he cannot tell what it is but only what it is like</i>, [my italics] e.g. <i>Republic</i> 506e, <i>Phaedrus</i> 246a, <i>Symposium</i> 215a.5.” This alludes to another reason why Plato uses so many similes, even though they can be “very slippery” [<i>Sophist</i> 3].</p>
                        <p>III§6. Finally, at [<i>Symposium</i> 14–15], Alcibiades states that he is going “to try to praise Socrates through images (= similes, <i>eikonôn</i>) … and the purpose of the comparison (<i>hê eikôn</i>) will be to tell the truth (<i>toû alêthous</i>), not to ridicule (<i>toû geloiou</i>).” The similes he provides (Silenuses, Marsyas, <i>aulos</i>-player) bring visual imagery (as well as humor) to his description of Socrates.</p>
                        <p>III§7. The similes in Plato illustrate all of the reasons or functions mentioned here, which we might label (a) clarification by visualization (abstract tenor, usually with a concrete vehicle); (b) verbal clarification (concrete tenors with vivid verbs); (c) clarification by differentiation (telling what something is NOT); (d) literary embellishment; and (e) humorous exaggeration. <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-13">13</a>]<a id="noteref_n-13"></a> </span> Without citing all of the similes found in this study, we will give illustrations in the following list and, for categories <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>e</i> refer to the Compendium for more examples. Many similes fit more than one classification since negative distinctions, humor and literary references may be found in both categories <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Note that here the distinctions are based on <i>function</i>, whereas the classification in Appendix III-B depends upon the <i>form</i> of the <i>prothesis</i>.</p>
                        <p>(a) Clarification by visualization (an abstract tenor is made concrete, specific or more familiar): <i>Death</i> is <b>like</b> <b><i>sleep</i></b> [<i>Apology</i> 7], <i>will power</i> is <b>like</b> the <b><i>rudder of a ship</i></b> [<i>Cleitophon</i> 1], <i>persuasion</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>rudder</i></b> [<i>Critias</i> 3], the <i>logos</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>ball</i></b> [<i>Euthydemus</i> 3], the <i>body</i> <b>is</b> our <b><i>tomb</i></b> [<i>Gorgias</i> 9], the <i>soul</i> <b>is</b> a <b><i>sieve</i></b> [<i>Gorgias</i> 11], the <i>state</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>human body</i></b> [<i>Laws</i> 1-1], <i>law</i> is <b>like</b> an <b><i>archer</i></b> [<i>Laws</i> 4-1], the <i>soul</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>book</i></b> [<i>Philebus</i> 5], <i>injustice</i> <b>is</b> a <b><i>kind of civil war</i></b> [<i>Republic</i>  4-10], <i>philosophy</i> is <b>like</b> an <b><i>orphan</i></b> [<i>Republic</i> 6.9], <i>democracy</i> is <b>like</b> a <b><i>garment of many colors</i></b> [<i>Republic</i> 8.9], <i>souls</i> are <b>like</b> <b><i>stars</i></b> [<i>Republic</i> 10.14], a <i>statesman’s art</i> is <b>like</b> <b><i>weaving</i></b> [<i>Statesman</i> 20], <i>courage and moderation</i> are <b>like</b> the <b><i>warp and woof</i></b> [<i>Statesman</i> 21], <i>knowledge</i> is <b>like</b> <b><i>wild birds</i></b> caught and placed in an aviary in our soul [<i>Theaetetus</i> 21].</p>
                        <p>(b) Verbal clarification (people or things are made more vivid by expressions that tell what they ‘looked like’, ‘felt like’, ‘sounded like’ etc.): Everyone <i>gazed at him</i> <b>as if</b> he were a <b><i>statue</i></b> [<i>Charmides</i> 2]; he/Critias <i>seemed to be as angry</i> with him/Charmides <b>as</b> a <b><i>poet with an actor</i></b> who delivers his verses badly [<i>Charmides</i> 4]; <i>we were as funny</i> <b>as</b> <b><i>children chasing larks</i></b> [<i>Euthydemus</i> 10]. Similes clarify looks and reactions by recalling more familiar things and situations (e.g. all of the similes in <i>Timaeus</i> from number 12 on comparing unfamiliar parts of the body to more familiar structures).</p>
                        <p>(c) Clarification by differentiation (in Plato by telling what something is NOT): e.g. “For this [praying for one’s own greatest evil] would be truly similar to some curse but NOT to a prayer” [<i>Alcibiades</i> 2.2]; and “All these [five] parts of virtue are NOT like pieces of gold similar to one another and to the whole of which they are parts, but like the parts of the face … dissimilar to each other” [<i>Protagoras</i> 16].</p>
                        <p>(d) Literary embellishment: “You will pray just as Oedipus prayed” [<i>Alcibiades</i> 2.1]; “I am ready to hand myself over to <i>Dionysodorus</i> here <b>as if</b> <i>he</i> were the [famous] <b><i>Medea of Colchis</i></b>” [<i>Euthydemus</i> 7]; “<i>I</i> am well disposed towards <i>you</i>, <i>Socrates</i>, and feel<b> somewhat like</b> <b><i>Zethus towards Amphion</i></b> in Euripides’ play” [<i>Gorgias</i> 8]; “Perhaps <i>we</i> feel shame <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) Homer said the <b><i>suitors</i></b> [felt], not deeming it right that there is someone else who will string the bow” [<i>Lovers</i> 1].</p>
                        <p>(e) Humorous exaggeration: “If you kill <i>me</i>, you will not easily find another such person, as it were – if I may speak somewhat humorously, attached to <i>this city</i> by the god, <b>as though</b> a <b><i>large and noble horse</i></b> (<i>hôsper hippô megalô</i>) lazy because of its size and needing to be waked up by <b><i>some gadfly</i></b> (<i>hypo myôpos</i>)” [<i>Apology</i> 3]; “<i>I</i> began to turn <b>like</b> a <b><i>fish caught in a net</i></b> [<i>Euthydemus</i> 15]; “If I may jest, <i>you</i> seem to me to be in appearance and other respects <b>most like</b> a <b><i>flat torpedo sea-fish/sting ray</i></b> [<i>Meno</i> 2]; “<b>Just like</b> <b><i>Lacanian hounds</i></b> <i>you</i> [Socrates] chase and track the things that have been said” [<i>Parmenides</i> 1]; “<i>I</i> have been filled somehow through my hearing <b>like</b> a <b><i>pitcher</i></b> [<i>Phaedrus</i> 4]; “<i>They</i> (the children of Pericles) go around grazing <b>like</b> <b><i>sacred cattle</i></b> [<i>Protagoras</i> 2]; “<i>Thrasymachus</i> seems to have been charmed by you [Socrates] <b>like</b> a <b><i>serpent</i></b> [<i>Republic</i> 2.1]; “<i>he</i> [<i>Socrates</i>] is <b>most similar to</b> <b><i>those Silenuses</i></b> sitting in the statuaries’ shops … <i>he</i> is <b>like</b> the <b><i>satyr Marsyas</i></b> [<i>Symposium</i> 14, 15]. Humor seems more concentrated in <i>Euthydemus</i>, <i>Protagoras</i>, <i>Republic</i> 1, <i>Symposium</i>, and <i>Theaetetus</i>. Although it is sometimes found in non-Socratic Dialogues like the <i>Laws</i> and <i>Statesman</i>, the main speakers in these never use self-effacing humor about themselves the way Socrates does.</p>
                        <p>III§8. One may still be surprised by the fact that there are so many similes in Plato and Xenophon, given Aristotle’s comments about their poetic nature: e.g. “similes are useful also in prose but <i>they should be used less frequently since there is something poetic about them</i>” (<i>Rhetoric</i> 3.4.1–4 [1406b–1407]). One explanation would be our reliance on a broader definition of simile than Aristotle’s; another is the great variety of prothetic words and phrases. Also Aristotle does not mention Xenophon in this connection, even though there is no lack of examples, as we have seen (Appendix IV-4).</p>
                        <h2>IV. Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>IV§1. E. E. Pender <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-14">14</a>]<a id="noteref_n-14"></a> </span> poses a challenging question about similes and other modes of comparison: “Since Plato expresses the view that images and likenesses are inferior to reality and can be deceptive, one might expect him to have avoided them. However, for all his criticisms, Plato not only uses a good many images, paradigms and analogies in his writings but also speaks of images as serving an important cognitive role.” We will conclude by offering an observation about this paradox. On the one hand, the images and similes help us see the common factor in two situations, the universal <i>paradeigma</i> illustrated by the particulars. On the other hand, we always run the risk of mistaking the <i>vehicle</i> for the <i>tenor</i>. Life, thus, is <i>not really</i> a dream or an underground dwelling, as a simile may suggest for the sake of illustrating an argument.</p>
                        <p>IV§2. Plato’s theoretical disapproval of comparisons is related to this danger of mistaken identity (or ‘fuzzy thinking’). This is well illustrated in the passage introduced by the simile at [<i>Euthydemus</i> 4: 277c]: “Euthydemus still continued to rush at the lad <i>having thrown him</i> [in debate] for the third time <b>as in</b> <b><i>wrestling</i></b>.” Socrates comes to the defense of the boy Cleinias by showing him how Euthydemus and Dionysidorus are ‘playing’ (<i>paizein</i> at 278b) with him by exploiting the different senses of words (<i>dia tên tôn onomatôn diaphoran</i>). The word under discussion is <i>manthanein</i>, applied both to ignorant people who gain knowledge and to learned people who advance to greater understanding (sometimes called<i> synienai</i>). Socrates compares the young men who engage in this kind of sophistic linguistic play to people who pull stools out from under others who are about to sit down and then laugh when they fall on their backs. Earlier (at 277e) Socrates compared them to the celebrants of the Corybantic mysteries, dancing and frolicking before Cleinias’ initiation. These pejorative verbal similes are effective devices for criticizing the intentional trickery involved in exploiting the two meanings of a word to win a debate. So in these cases Plato chooses examples that illustrate the danger of identifying tenor and vehicle. Tenors are not the same as vehicles any more than one art is equivalent to another: “In all the arts (<i>technai</i>), what we know by one art we will not know (<i>ou gnôsometha</i>)<i> </i>by another” (<i>Ion</i> 537d). Socrates’ negative view of similes contained in the quotation at <i>Republic</i> 5.476c is notable considering his fondness for similes as a stylistic feature: <span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-15">15</a>]<a id="noteref_n-15"></a> </span> “Consider this: To dream, whether one is asleep or awake, means to think that <i>something similar to another thing is the same thing</i>.” A little later in the next book (<i>Republic</i> 6.508d) he expresses a similar precaution: “But as for knowledge and truth (<i>epistêmên de kai alêtheian</i>), as in our [illustration] (<i>houtô kai entaûtha</i>), it is right to consider light and vision (<i>phôs te kai opsin</i>) sun-like (<i>hêlioeidê</i>), but never to think they are the sun (<i>hêlion de hêgeîsthai ouk orthôs echei</i>).”</p>
                        <p>IV§3. Plato’s warning is repeated at [<i>Sophist</i> 3 (231a)]: “the cautious man must be especially on his guard in the matter of resemblances (<i>tas homoiotêtas</i>), for they are very slippery things (<i>olisthêrotaton to genos</i>).” It is a warning that in philosophical matters one must not confuse <i>tenor</i> with <i>vehicle</i> because the <i>vehicle</i> is never exactly identical to its <i>tenor</i>. As long as the reader (or listener) remains aware that analogies and similes are always only approximations, one may appreciate them both as stylistic adornments and as guideposts to understanding.</p>

Looking out of the window, he said, ‘You should play it <b>like that</b>.’ From the bridge the river seemed impossibly wide, and instead of a single current there seemed to be a million intersecting currents—urgent and lazy rivers within the river, magical pockets of no motion at all. The late-afternoon light colored the water pink and orange and gold. It was the most beautiful, patient, meandering multiplicity. Instantly, I knew how to play the passage.”<b> A simile</b> had a demonstrative effect that no amount of prosaic description or thought could provide.</p>

Silk, “metaphor and simile” (<i>OCD</i> 1996), identifies three “main poetic functions of metaphor and simile in ancient usage” that partially coincide with my categories: “to make clearer,” “to make immediate,” and “to exploit the associations … of the vehicle.”</p>
