                        <h4>A. What Is A Simile?</h4>
                        <h4>1. Aristotle</h4>

                        <div>
                            <p>1§1. Aristotle&#8217;s pronouncement that similes differ from metaphors by the presence
                                of an introductory word (‘as’ or ‘like’) has continued to provide the distinction
                                between these two figures to this day. The <em>American</em> <em>Heritage</em> <em>College</em>
                                <em>Dictionary</em> following Aristotle (<em>Rhetoric</em> Book Three) defines similes
                                as figures of speech &#8220;in which two essentially unlike things are explicitly
                                compared, usually by means of <em>like</em> or <em>as</em>.&#8221; According to this
                                conventional distinction, “You are my sunshine” is a metaphor and “Your eyes are <em>like</em>
                                stars” is a simile, the only difference in construction being the word ‘like’ that is
                                said to make the comparison explicit. Most discussions leave it at that, as though
                                similes were limited to expressions with these two words, plus a few others, that act as
                                sign-posts (<em>prothesis</em> [or perhaps <em>prosthesis</em>]) indicating that a
                                simile is coming, whereas in metaphors the comparison is implicit.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>1§2. Aristotle’s discussion of similes (<em>eikônes</em>) at <em>Rhetoric</em> 3.4.1–4
                            (1406b–1407) follows his remarks about faults in prose style, the fourth form being ‘bad
                            taste’ or ‘frigidity’ (<em>to</em> <em>psychron</em>) in the use of inappropriate metaphors.
                            He introduces the term ‘simile’ (<em>eikôn</em>) here (<em>esti</em> <em>de</em>
                            <em>kai</em> <em>eikôn</em> <em>metaphora;</em> <em>dipherei</em> <em>gar</em>
                            <em>mikron</em>, ‘the simile is also a metaphor; for there is very little difference’) and
                            distinguishes it from metaphor by the example in the <em>Iliad</em> (20.164) where Achilles
                            ‘rose up like a lion’ (<em>hôrto</em> <em>leôn</em> <em>hôs</em>) although Aristotle uses a
                            slightly different reading (<em>hôs</em> <em>de</em> <em>leôn</em> <em>eporeusen</em>). If
                            Homer had said simply “he rose up, a lion” that would be a metaphor since no word is
                            included to indicate the shift in meaning (<em>meta-phora</em>) of the word ‘lion’ from its
                            literal to a symbolic sense.<span id="noteref_n-1" class="noteref"><span class="noteref"> [<a
                                    href="#n-1">1</a>] </span></span>He emphasizes that the
                            difference is minor and that “similes are [the same thing as] metaphors [that are] lacking a
                            word” (<em>hai</em> <em>eikones</em> <i>metaphorai</i> <em>logou</em> <em>deomenai</em> at
                            3.4.3, 1407a15) or “without the details” (Freese, LCL) but that otherwise they are the same.<span
                                    class="noteref"><span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-2">2</a>] <a
                                    id="noteref_n-2"></a></span></span>He adds that similes are useful also in prose
                            but that they should be used less frequently since there is something poetic about them.

                        <div>
                            <p>1§3. In his next brief allusion to similes (3.10.3, 1410b18), with reference to poetry
                                some fifteen pages later, Aristotle adds another distinction, stating that they are
                                metaphors “differing in explicitness” (<em>prothesis</em> or
                                <em>pro</em><em><strong>s</strong></em><em>thesis</em>). <em>Prothesis</em> (the reading
                                of the Paris manuscript) refers to “the manner of setting forth” (Cope), whereas <em>prosthesis</em>
                                would be “the addition of a word” (Freese, LCL), usually understood to mean the particle
                                of comparison (thus a more appropriate word for ‘like’ and ‘as’).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>1§4. Aristotle gives ten examples of similes in the first passage (<em>Rhetoric</em>
                                3.4.2–4), thereby illustrating the variety of introductory expressions
                                (<em>protheses</em>): “Androtion said that Idrieus was <strong>like</strong> (<em>homoios</em>)
                                a little dog (in the dative case) let off his leash”; “Theodamas
                                <strong>compared</strong> (<em>eikazen</em>) Archidamus to an Euxene (dative) ignorant
                                of geometry”; in Plato’s <em>Republic</em> (5.469e), “those who strip the dead <strong>are </strong><strong>like</strong>
                                (<em>eoikasi</em>) little dogs (dative) which bite stones but do not touch those who
                                throw them”;<span class="noterefn_3"><span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-3">3</a>] <a
                                        id="noteref_n-3"></a></span></span>“the [Athenian] <em>dêmos</em> is <strong>like</strong>
                                (<em>homoios</em>) a ship’s captain (dative) who is strong but somewhat deaf”
                                (6.488a)<span class="noteref"><span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-4">4</a>]<a
                                        id="noteref_n-4"></a></span></span>; “poets’ verses are<strong> like</strong>
                                (<em>eoike</em>) handsome young men (dative) without real beauty” (10.601b); Pericles
                                said “the Samians <strong>were like </strong>(<em>eoikenai</em>) children (dative) who
                                take their bit of food but continue to cry”; and said that “the Boeotians are <strong>like</strong>
                                (<em>homoioi</em>) holm-oaks” (dative); Demosthenes said that the <em>dêmos</em> “is
                                <strong>like</strong> (<em>homoios</em>) sea-sick passengers (dative) on a ship”;
                                Democrates “<strong>compared</strong> (<em>eikase</em>) orators to nurses” (dative); and
                                Antisthenes “<strong>compared</strong> (<em>eikasen</em>) the lean Cephisodotus to
                                frankincense (dative).” It is interesting to note that in several of these examples the
                                introductory word is contained in the verb (“are like,” “compared”) rather than standing
                                separately (e.g. “like”); and in all the examples the dative case is used for the
                                simile. Presumably the <em>prothesis</em> is contained in the verbs <em>eoikenai</em>
                                and <em>eikase</em>.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>1§5. In his third citation (at 3.11.4) Aristotle quotes a line [<em>Iliad</em> 13.799]
                                from what he calls one of Homer’s “popular similes”
                                (<em>eudokimousais </em><em>eikosin</em>) comparing a Trojan attack to huge waves pushed
                                by a wind-storm sent by Zeus (13.795-801). This is an example of personifying inanimate
                                things, as in proportional metaphors. A few pages later (at 3.11.11–13, 1412–1413)
                                Aristotle gives other examples of proportional similes, consisting of two terms like the
                                proportional metaphor (<em>hê</em> <i>analogon </i><em>metaphora</em>), “as when we say,
                                for instance (<em>hoîon</em>), that the shield is (<em>esti</em>) the goblet of Ares and
                                the bow a lyre without strings … They also make comparisons (<em>eikazousi</em>) as
                                follows: for example (<em>hoîon</em>) [they compare] a flute player (<em>aulêtên</em>)
                                to an ape (<em>pithêkôi</em>), a short-sighted man (<em>myôpa</em>) to a sputtering lamp
                                (<em>lychnôi</em> <em>psakazomenôi</em>).” Then he says that “it is possible to liken a
                                shield to the goblet of Ares and a ruin to the rag of a house; to say that Niceratus is
                                (<em>eînai</em>) a Philoctetes bitten by Pratys, to use the <em>simile</em> of
                                Thrasymachus (<em>hôsper</em> <em>eikase</em> <em>Thrasymachos</em>) etc.” The
                                phraseology here is somewhat confusing, since it is not altogether clear which examples
                                are similes and which are metaphors. It would appear, nevertheless, that ‘proportional’
                                similes do not always exhibit a <em>prothesis</em>, merely the verb ‘is’, as in the last
                                citation.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>1§6. Thus Aristotle takes up the matter of similes in four different paragraphs in <em>Rhetoric</em>
                                Book Three (although he does not mention them anywhere else in his works): 3.4,
                                1406b4–1407a (definition and examples); 3.10.3, 1410b (comparison of simile and
                                metaphor); 3.11.4 and 3.11.11–13, 1413a (simple and proportional similes). This
                                repetition, three times insisting upon the near identity of the two rhetorical figures,
                                is curious, suggesting a distinction without a real difference. When Aristotle cites, or
                                rather paraphrases, two similes (<em>eikones</em>) from Plato’s <em>Republic</em>
                                (quoted earlier), he adds words of comparison (<em>eoikasi</em> and <em>homoios</em>)
                                that are not in the original, thus showing how naturally such words are implied and how
                                easily one form can be turned into another. Then in his discussion of the four kinds of
                                metaphor Aristotle cites as his first example (<em>kat’</em> <em>analogian</em>, ‘by
                                analogy’) Pericles’ comparison of the youth lost in the war to the loss of spring (<em>hôsper
                                    ei tis to ear ek tou eniautou exheloi</em>, “<strong>as if</strong> someone had
                                taken the spring out of the year” at <em>Rhetoric</em> 3.10.7, 1411a). This is an odd
                                example of a metaphor because it is in the form of a simile introduced by the prothetic
                                word <em>hôsper</em>. Perhaps in Pericles’ original speech it was a metaphor (i.e. “the
                                spring has been taken from the year” with no mention of ‘the youth’ and no ‘as if’), but
                                we cannot tell since it is impossible to distinguish a simple metaphor from a simile in
                                a paraphrased form. Aristotle quotes the same passage at <em>Rhetoric</em> I 7.34, 1365a
                                in a slightly different way: “as Pericles said in his funeral oration, that the youth
                                were taken away (<em>anhêirêsthai</em>) from the city <strong>as though</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>)
                                the spring had been robbed (<em>to ear ek toû eniautoû ei exhairetheiê</em>) from the
                                year.” It is not clear why this is not called a simile.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>1§7. Aristotle’s interest in metaphors was much greater than in similes, which he barely
                                acknowledges as a distinct figure of speech, whereas he discusses metaphors in several
                                sections of four different works (<em>Poetics,</em> <em>Posterior</em>
                                <em>Analytics,</em> <em>Rhetoric</em>, and <em>Topics</em>). The <em>Rhetoric</em> also
                                contains some rather odd remarks about similes that illustrate an important difference
                                between ancient and modern perspectives on these rhetorical figures. Aristotle says, for
                                example, that they are “less attractive” (<em>hêdu</em>) than metaphors because they are
                                longer (presumably in Homer); and since they do not express the comparison directly,
                                “they do not appeal so much to the soul” (<em>oude</em> <em>zêtei</em> <i>tout</i> <em>hê</em>
                                <em>psychê</em>, 3.10, 1410b18–20). He advises a speaker to convert a <em>daring</em> or
                                <em>dangerous</em> metaphor into a simile for “thus it would become safer” (<em>asphalestera</em>).
                                Another surprising statement is that “similes are poetic by nature and not often used in
                                prose” (1406b24), an observation that ignores the many similes in Plato’s Dialogues—and
                                even in Aristotle himself, who adds similes at appropriate places to illustrate his
                                topic.<span class="noteref"><span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-5">5</a>] <a
                                        id="noteref_n-5"></a></span></span>Such comments reveal an ancient perspective
                                with terminology (like “proportional similes”) and concerns about rhetorical figures
                                that are quite different from those of modern scholars, to whom we will now turn to
                                consider how the notion of similes has changed.</p>

                            <p>2§1. “In the last forty years, according to G. R. Boys-Stones, the ‘classical’ definition
                                of metaphor inherited from the ancient rhetoricians has lost its canonical status.”<span

                                Marsh McCall states that the ancient “critics indiscriminately apply the various terms
                                to all forms of comparison” and “of the four major terms of comparison—<em>eikôn</em>,
                                <em>parabolê</em>, <em>imago</em>, and <em>similitudo</em>—no one of them refers
                                appreciably more to a particular form of comparison, such as simile, than do the other
                                three.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-7">7</a>] <a id="noteref_n-7"></a></span>The
                                Latin word <em>simile</em> also could be added to this list. Stanford, observing that
                                “Cicero and Quintilian reverse Aristotle’s opinion and imagine that metaphor is a
                                species of simile, not simile of metaphor,” notes that “most moderns hold to the Roman

                                that opinion is divided about the importance of the distinction between similes and
                                metaphors: some argue that the difference is merely one of grammatical form and others
                                insist that “this very difference has important consequences in terms of function and
                                effect.” In Pender’s opinion, “similes strictly do not involve figurative usage but are
                                always literal” and she agrees with earlier scholars claiming that it is the very
                                presence of ‘like’ that guarantees literalness. Stanford suggests that “[t]he truth
                                probably is that metaphor and simile are not generically related at all” and only “the
                                very lowest types of simile and metaphor are interchangeable” (1936:28). Thus the range
                                of scholarly opinion on this matter is wide. Perhaps Greek and Roman theorists did not
                                care to make a clear distinction between similes and metaphors because similes did not
                                easily fit into the kinds of categories with which they were most concerned: <em>schemata</em>
                                (different arrangement or order of words) and <em>tropoi</em> (figures of speech, words
                                used in a different sense) since similes were considered literal comparisons with words
                                used in the normal meaning—as long as the signpost word of ‘warning’ (‘like’ or ‘as’) is
                                heeded that two spheres are being brought together that are normally separate. Such an
                                indicator was regarded as essential to designate the comparison between a word used in
                                its literal sense (Achilles) and another word used literally (lion) in a simile but
                                figuratively in a metaphor.</p>

                                ‘as’) has led some scholars to arrange similes into various types, with those at the
                                ‘lower’ end corresponding to Aristotle but “the more artistic and typical types of
                                simile and metaphor being quite distinct.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-11">11</a>] <a

                                by recent scholars (simple and more complex similes, literal and figurative, modeling
                                and illustrative).<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-12">12</a>] <a
                                        id="noteref_n-12"></a></span>According to Stanford (1936:28–29), “[s]imile is
                                below the finest metaphor … the finest type of metaphor transcends the explicitness of
                                paraphrase … the difference is like that between prose and poetry. Simile, like prose,
                                is analytic, metaphor, like poetry, is synthetic etc.” Such a complex hierarchy becomes
                                burdensome and perhaps unnecessary if we can find a distinction between simile and
                                metaphor that captures the essential and not merely a linguistic difference.
                                Furthermore, the claims that metaphors are more poetic, more artistic or &#8220;sweeter&#8221;
                                than similes are not helpful criteria in English at least, where the difference between
                                prose and poetry is not always clear; and even with some distinguishing features in mind
                                it would be difficult to show that they occur more often in metaphors than in similes,
                                or that metaphors are on a higher literary plane than similes. But I agree with Stanford
                                (and Aristotle) that the difference between the “lowest” type of metaphor and simile is
                                minimal; and I would suggest not even making that distinction since metaphors of that
                                type may be considered ‘predicate’ similes.</p>

                            <p>3§1. Recent research has provided distinctions between the two rhetorical figures that
                                were not considered in antiquity. As the Dictionary definition quoted earlier shows
                                (‘two <strong>essentially unlike things</strong> are explicitly compared’), we have
                                added a qualification not made by Aristotle, namely that in similes the linguistic
                                comparison must be figurative, not literal. This is an important addition because
                                presumably not all comparisons should be called similes. &#8220;She ran faster than her
                                brother,” for example, is a literal comparison of two similar entities, whereas &#8220;she
                                ran faster than the wind&#8221; is an exaggerated, figurative comparison and thus a
                                simile. (See below, section 8. Non-Similes-Criteria for Selection). If we rely merely on
                                the format or phraseology of the sentence, we would not be able to distinguish a real
                                simile (“Achilles is like a lion”) from a simple comparison (“Achilles is like his
                                brother”). With this in mind I would like to suggest that most metaphors cannot be
                                changed into similes merely by the addition of a single word because the difference is
                                more than phraseology. Metaphor is a useful concept for denoting a manner of speaking in
                                which a person’s language refers to one sphere and his meaning to another
                                (<i>metaphora</i> <em>de</em> <em>estin</em> <em>onomatos</em> <em>allotriou</em> <em>epiphora</em>,
                                “metaphor is the application of a noun which properly applies to something else”
                                according to Aristotle’s definition in the <em>Poetics</em> 21, 1457b7), as when
                                Socrates uses racing terminology in reply to Hermogenes’ observation that he seems to be
                                hurrying the argument along: “Yes, for I am <strong>running the last lap</strong> now” (<em>Cratylus</em>
                                420d). Notable metaphors may be found at <em>Statesman</em> 311b (where by the <strong>web</strong>
                                of the statesman’s activity the royal science <strong>clothes</strong> all the
                                inhabitants of the state with the <strong>fabric</strong> of harmony and friendship
                                etc.) and <em>Charmides</em> 155d: &#8220;I saw what was under his cloak and <strong>I
                                    caught fire</strong> (<em>eîdón</em> <em>te </em><em>tà</em> <em>entòs</em>
                                <em>toû</em> <em>himatíou</em> <em>kaì</em> <em>ephlegómên</em>),” where Socrates
                                implies that he was a piece of wood to Charmides&#8217; fire. You cannot turn these
                                statements into similes simply by adding ‘like’ or ‘as’; you would have to add similetic
                                phrases (italicized): “I am <em>like</em> <em>a</em> <em>racer</em> running the last
                                lap”; or “I saw what was under his cloak and I <em>felt</em> <em>like</em> <em>a</em>

                                definitive distinction. Consider the following examples:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>&#8220;All the souls (620d) … then suddenly were carried up one after the other … to
                                    their birth darting <strong>like</strong> stars (<em>hosper</em> <em>asteras</em>).&#8221;
                                    (<em>Republic</em> 10.621b: Socrates reporting Er&#8217;s vision)
                                </li>
                                <li>&#8220;The herdsman himself is the <em>caretaker</em> of the herd, he himself is its
                                    <em>doctor</em>, he himself is <strong>like</strong> its <em>matchmaker</em> etc.&#8221;
                                    The Stranger (<em>Statesman</em> 268a-b)
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The first example is without question a simile according to our traditional definition,
                                identifiable by the presence of &#8216;like&#8217;. In the second quotation, however,
                                the word is missing in the first two comparisons and expressed only in the third.
                                Following Aristotle’s dictum many would make a distinction based on such a trivial
                                difference, calling the first two comparisons in #2 &#8216;metaphors&#8217; and only the
                                third a &#8216;simile&#8217;. However, since the two parts of the comparison
                                (<em>tenor</em> and <em>vehicle</em>) are expressed in all cases, one might argue that
                                all these examples are similes: souls (<em>tenor</em>) = stars (<em>vehicle</em>);
                                herdsman (<em>tenor</em>) = caretaker, doctor, matchmaker (<em>vehicles</em>). Here is
                                another example, from Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> 18.107–110:</p>

                                be called similes introduced by different words, a comparative adjective in Greek

                                use of some helpful modern terminology. Here is a case in which “the Greeks”
                                <em>did</em> <em>not</em> “have a word for it”: the parts of a simile that we now call
                                <em>tenor</em> and <em>vehicle</em> (thanks to I. A. Richards).<span

                                        id="noteref_n-14"></a></span></span>The terms ‘tenor’ and ‘vehicle’ are
                                perhaps not ideal indicators for the two parts of a simile but they have become
                                traditional. Regardless of the meaning they held for I. A. Richards when he coined them
                                in 1936, they have become essentially ‘dead metaphors’ and merely technical terms. Other
                                pairs of words have been suggested, but these are the two that are used without
                                explanation by most scholars.<span class="noteref"><span class="noteref"> [<a

                                provide an important justification for revising our distinction between simile and
                                metaphor. Let us define a <strong>simile</strong> as &#8220;a figurative comparison in
                                which both <em>tenor</em> and <em>vehicle</em> are expressed (with or without a <em>prothesis</em>)&#8221;
                                while a <strong>metaphor</strong> is &#8220;an implied comparison in which only the <em>vehicle</em>
                                is stated.&#8221;</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>3§4. It is also worth remembering that the Greek word for simile (<em>eikôn</em>) has a
                                more precise meaning (“likeness” or “image, as in a mirror or painting”) than our
                                Latin-derived word (<em>simile</em>) as well as a visual aspect so that the logic of
                                Aristotle’s distinction with metaphor (change in a word to a new sense) is less apparent
                                in English. For this reason it is more difficult for us to see a significant distinction
                                between Aristotle’s example of metaphor (“Achilles rose up a lion [in a new sense of the
                                word]”) and simile (“Achilles is like a lion”). After all, are we to assume that in the
                                metaphoric version Achilles really turns into a lion? Such expressions are figures of
                                speech that emphasize his lion-like violence in the strongest terms. In another context
                                <em>eikôn</em> would seem to be a more appropriate word for the expression “Achilles
                                rose up a lion” since it is a stronger word. Does one visualize a lion any less when the
                                word ‘like’ is present? And what effect does the commonly added word <em>tis</em> have
                                on the expression (“Achilles rose up <strong>a kind of</strong> lion”)? In English even
                                the presence of an article (‘a/an’ or ‘the’) makes a difference in meaning: cf. ‘he is
                                [like] a lion among sheep’ with ‘he is [like] the Lion (of Judah).’ It seems better to
                                let the combined presence of <em>tenor</em> and <em>vehicle</em> be the determining
                                factor in identifying a simile.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>3§5. Consider these formulaic variations of the Socratic saying “<em>we</em> [Greeks] are
                                <strong>like</strong> <em> <strong>frogs</strong></em>” (<em>Phaedo</em> 109b), where
                                the <em>tenor</em> is italicized, the <em>prothesis</em> is emboldened, and the <em>vehicle</em>
                                is italicized and emboldened. Socrates could have expressed this sentiment in various
                                other ways, each differing slightly in style and emphasis: <em>&#8216;Greeks</em>
                                <strong>remind me of</strong> <em><strong>frogs</strong></em>&#8216;; <em>
                                    &#8216;they</em> act <strong>just like</strong> <em><strong>frogs</strong></em>&#8216;;
                                <em>&#8216;they</em> <strong>are very much like</strong> <em><strong>frogs</strong></em>&#8216;
                                (<em><strong>frog</strong></em><em>-like</em>); <em>&#8216;they</em> <strong>are no
                                    different from</strong> <em><strong>frogs</strong></em>&#8216;; &#8216;in fact, <em>they</em>
                                <strong>are</strong> <em><strong>frogs</strong></em>!&#8217; Must we insist that the
                                last variant be called a metaphor when it differs from the other variations only in the
                                omission of a word but that otherwise it is simply a variant expression of the
                                comparison? The last variation is actually the strongest version, omitting the
                                introductory word or phrase but nevertheless still a simile, since as in all the
                                versions both tenor and vehicle are stated. We may think of an ascending scale of
                                predicate assertions (similes) ending in the strongest form, an equivalence (‘they are
                                frogs’ or ‘Achilles is a lion’). Rhetorically this final form is no different from the
                                preceding variations except in the strength of its assertiveness. The differences
                                between saying that “the <em>heart</em> is <strong>like</strong> a
                                <em><strong>lonely</strong> </em><em><strong>hunter</strong></em>” (<em>simile</em>) or
                                “the <em>heart</em> is a <em><strong>lonely</strong>
                                </em><em><strong>hunter</strong></em>” (so-called <em>metaphor</em>) are matters of
                                style that may harbor subtle distinctions of emphasis, but in terms of syntactical
                                clarity they are equivalent. Hence in this collection we will consider many variations
                                of similetic expression as in the Socratic examples above (see Sections 5 and 6 below
                                for further discussion).</p>

                        <h4>4. Some Implications of This New Definition of Simile</h4>

                        <div>
                            <p>4§1. Let us consider some of the advantages of this proposal. First of all we would avoid
                                the disadvantages of the traditional distinction: confusion, uncertainty and
                                inconsistency. According to Steve Nimis, “[t]he interpenetration of simile and metaphor
                                has proven to be a most confusing issue in discussions of these figures of speech, and
                                the confusion also seems to go all the way back to Aristotle.”<span class="noteref"> [<a

                                Boys-Stones&#8217; more recent assessment above (at the beginning of Section 2). Another
                                flaw is that similar constructions are given different names, as in the Homeric passage
                                (<em>Iliad</em> 18.107–110) quoted earlier. Similarly, the same construction is
                                sometimes called both a simile and a metaphor: at <em>Critias</em> 109b5–7 a passage
                                comparing gods to shepherds (&#8220;just as a shepherd tends his flock&#8221;) is called
                                a metaphor on one page of a scholarly book (&#8220;the established shepherd metaphor”)
                                and a “shepherd simile” on the next.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-17">17</a>] <a

                                description of himself <em>as</em> <em>a</em> <em>midwife</em> a “perfect metaphor” for
                                his philosophic mission and quotes Socrates’ statement: “My art of midwifery is
                                <em>like</em> <em>that</em> <em>of</em> <em>midwives</em>.” He offers other “images”
                                (read ‘similes’) of his mission <em>as</em> <em>a</em> <em>gadfly</em> (<em>Apology</em>
                                30e), <em>a</em> <em>Spartan</em> <em>hound</em> (<em>Parmenides</em> 128c) and a <em>stingray</em>
                                (<em>Meno</em> 802). The range of scholarly opinion on this matter is wide, with
                                followers of Aristotle perhaps in the majority versus those who see a problem inherent
                                in the traditional distinction. According to E. E. Pender, who follows the traditional
                                definition, “similes strictly do not involve figurative usage but are always literal”
                                whereas W. B. Stanford concludes that “metaphor and simile are not generically related
                                at all.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-19">19</a>]</span><br/>

                                between the two figures of speech.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-20">20</a>] <a
                                        id="noteref_n-20"></a></span>Some writers avoid the terms entirely by
                                referring to them both as &#8220;comparative images.&#8221;<span class="noteref"> [<a

                                confusion a great proliferation of terms has been produced by scholars (Blondell,
                                Boys-Stones, Innes, Kittay, Mac Cormac, Pender, Silk) in order to distinguish between
                                what they see as subtle differences between many types of metaphors: illustrative versus
                                modeling, simple versus complex, ordinary versus deviant, normal versus abnormal, first
                                and second order, geometry model versus feature-matching model, <em>diaphors</em> versus
                                <em>epiphors</em>; and terms like &#8216;impertinent epithet&#8217;, &#8216;terminologically
                                alien&#8217; &#8216;metaphorical transference&#8217; and &#8216;extension by synecdoche&#8217;
                                are evidence of the complexity of the traditional development; Pender calls
                                <em>metaphor</em>, <em>metonymy</em>, and <em>synecdoche</em> all types of <em>catachresis</em>.<span

                                is not always clear what is meant by a &#8216;theory of metaphor&#8217; and no one talks
                                about a &#8216;theory of simile&#8217;. Ironically, the difference between these two
                                figures is conventionally thought to be simple and a sign of basic education (&#8220;he
                                does not even know the difference between a simile and a metaphor&#8221;) whereas the
                                reality is more complicated. Many points of confusion suggest that a new definition
                                would be more helpful than continuing to rely on Aristotle&#8217;s original distinction
                                that has caused so many problems.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-23">23</a>]<a

                                hundreds of books on metaphors, but probably only a short list of works devoted to
                                similes.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-24">24</a>] <a

                                of Aristotle&#8217;s definition. There is even an international society to promote the

                                help find them.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-27">27</a>] <a
                                        id="noteref_n-27"></a></span>The popularity of the word may be illustrated by
                                the frequent usage of the term <em>metaphor</em> in the daily press, where it has become
                                a cliché to say that a certain movie or artistic creation &#8220;is a metaphor for life.&#8221;
                                The Homeric epics are said to have &#8220;provided two of our guiding <em>metaphors</em>—<em>life</em>
                                <em>as</em> <em>a</em> <em>battle</em> (<em>Iliad</em>) and <em>life</em> <em>as</em>
                                <em>a</em> <em>journey</em> (<em>Odyssey</em>); Troy has come to stand for every city
                                and Odysseus for Everyman.&#8221;<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-28">28</a>] <a
                                        id="noteref_n-28"></a></span>Even here, however, the metaphors are illustrated
                                by similes. In some cases, where the word <em>symbol</em> or <em>image</em> would
                                suffice, people prefer to use <em>metaphor</em>. The proposed distinction would produce
                                a more simplified terminology, making the distinction between similes and metaphors more
                                logical and precise, while retaining Aristotle’s notion of ‘explicitness’ in the
                                expression of tenor and vehicle rather than in the presence of a prothetic word.</p>

                        <h4>C. Further Discussion</h4>
                        <h4>5. Examples of Introductory Words (<em>Protheses</em>) in English and Greek</h4>

                        <div>
                            <p>5§1. In English there are many more introductory expressions than the two proverbial
                                words ‘as’ and ‘like’—and no word is more appropriate than Aristotle’s
                                <em>prothesis</em> for such introductory expressions. First of all, we may note the
                                various combinations of ‘as’: ‘<em>as</em> American <em>as</em> apple pie’; ‘in its
                                sleep the dog moved its feet <em>as</em> <em>if</em> chasing a cat’; ‘they look
                                <em>as</em> <em>though</em> they had been molded by an artist’; and ‘she placed the
                                rubber band on her finger, a wedding ring <em>as</em> <em>it</em> <em>were</em>’. There
                                are also other common phrases besides ‘like’: (adjectival) <em>similar</em> <em>to</em>
                                (‘<em>similar</em> <em>to</em> a butterfly’) and <em>than</em> (‘<em>faster</em> <em>than</em>
                                a speeding bullet’); and (verbal): ‘Every man should <em>regard</em> the soul
                                [<em>as</em>] a god’ (<em>Laws</em> 10.4). The word ‘as’ is not in the text but it is
                                implied and often expressed in translation. This is true for many synonymous verbs (like
                                <em>consider</em>, <em>think</em>, <em>view</em>): “They considered her a goddess for
                                her good works.” The words ‘as’ or ‘like’ may be omitted or expressed without changing
                                the meaning at all, indicating again that a simile may be expressed without this word.
                                ‘Our city <em>resembles</em> the head of a wise man (how should we <em>compare</em>
                                it?): the city <em>is</em> the skull, the guardians <em>are</em> the eyes.’
                                (<em>Laws</em> 12.3) Recently the phrases ‘as it were’ and ‘if you will’ have become
                                popular for introducing a simile: “I also believe that <em>medical</em>
                                <em>marijuana</em> is, <strong>if you will</strong>, <em>a</em> <em>Trojan</em> <em>Horse</em>
                                for bringing marijuana into our society.”</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>5§2. Greek has as many introductory expressions as English, and probably more because of
                                the added variety of different cases not found in English. In addition to obvious words
                                meaning ‘like’ and ‘such as’ (<em>hôsper</em>, <em>hoios</em>, <em>hôs</em>, and <em>kathaper</em>),
                                there are also comparative and superlative adjectives (e.g., <em>homoiotatos</em>, ‘most
                                similar to’) and verbs that take the genitive (<em>diapherô</em>, &#8216;to surpass&#8217;)
                                or dative (<em>apeikazô</em>, ‘compare to,’ <em>heoika</em>, ‘be like’). Aristotle’s
                                examples include the adjectival and adverbial forms of ‘like’ (<em>homoios</em> and <em>hôs</em>)
                                as well as the intransitive verb ‘are like’ (<em>eoikasi</em> with the dative) and the
                                transitive verb ‘compare to’ (<em>eikazen</em>). In this Compendium “like” is expressed
                                in various ways: as a superlative adjective: “ most similar to” (<em>homoiotatos</em>
                                with the dative case) a ‘torpedo fish’ ([<em>narkêi</em>] at <em>Meno</em> 2); as a
                                noun: “like” (<em>dikên</em> with the genitive) a ‘rooster’ (<i>alectryonos</i> at <em>Theaetetus</em>
                                6); a preposition: “like” (<em>kata</em> with accusative) ‘Antaeus’ ([<em>Antaeon</em>]
                                at <em>Theaetetus</em> 10); and a verb: “are like” (<em>eoiken</em> with the dative
                                case) ‘the works of Daedalus’ (at <em>Euthyphro</em> 3).<span class="noteref"> [<a

                        <div>
                            <p>6§1. The similes in the text of Plato may be divided into three main categories (I–III)
                                and one very minor one (IV), as follows:</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p><strong>I. Conventional</strong>. A <em>prothesis</em> (such as ‘as’ or ‘like’) is
                                expressed, often with two nouns as tenor and vehicle: “Dionysodorus caught <em>the line
                                    of argument </em>(<em>logos</em>) <strong>like</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>) a
                                <em><strong>ball </strong></em>(<em>sphairan</em>)” (<em>Euthyphro</em> 3); “I must rein
                                in <em>my speech</em> <strong>like</strong> (<em>hoîonper</em>) a
                                <em><strong>horse </strong></em>(<em>hippon</em>) (<em>Laws</em> 3.2).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p><strong>II. Alternative</strong>. Comparison is made by (a) <em>verbal expressions of
                                similarity or difference</em>: “[<em>Such men</em> do not] <strong>differ</strong> (<em>diapherein</em>)
                                at all <em>from</em> a <em><strong>little bald-headed copper smith </strong></em>(<em>chalkeôs</em>)”
                                (<em>Republic</em> 6.11); a <em>wolf</em> <strong>is similar to</strong>
                                (<em>proseoike</em>) a <em><strong>dog </strong></em>(<em>Sophist</em> 3); or (b) <em>comparative
                                    adjectives and certain nouns</em> (e.g. <em>dikên </em>and <em>tropon</em>): for I
                                say that <em>he</em> [<em>Socrates</em>] is <strong>most similar to</strong> (<em>homoiotaton</em>)
                                those <em><strong>Silenuses </strong></em>(<em>toîs silênois</em>) [sitting in the
                                statuaries&#8217; shops]” (<em>Symposium</em> 14); “<em>I</em> have been filled somehow
                                … <strong>like</strong> (<em>dikên</em>) a <em><strong>pitcher </strong></em>(<em>angeiou</em>)”
                                (<em>Phaedrus</em> 4). Sometimes (c) the <em>genitive</em> case implies a comparison:
                                “<em><strong>ship of </strong></em><em>state</em>” or “<em><strong>journey of </strong></em>our
                                <em>conversation</em>” (<em>Critias </em>1), where the preposition ‘of’ (in English)
                                serves as a kind of <em>prothesis</em> with the <em>tenor</em> and <em>vehicle</em> in
                                reverse order (the <em>state</em> ‘is like’ a <em><strong>ship</strong></em>,
                                ‘ship-like’; our <em>conversation</em> ‘<strong>is like</strong>’ a
                                <em><strong>journey</strong></em>). Most genitive constructions, however, indicate
                                possession (‘mother’s milk’) or fullness (‘can of worms’) etc.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p><strong>III. Implicit</strong>. A <em>prothesis</em> (‘as’ or ‘like’) is implied either
                                in <em>appositional</em> (“the <strong>heart</strong>, [like] a lonely <em><strong>hunter</strong></em>”)
                                or <em>predicate</em> construction. The predicate may be <em>nominative</em> (“The <em>body</em>

                                [<strong>as</strong>] a <em><strong>god </strong></em>(<em>theon</em>)” (<em>Laws</em>
                                10.4).</p>

                        <div>
                            <p><strong>IV. Denominative</strong>. Similes may be embedded in adjectives, adverbs and
                                verbs: “<em><strong>trophy </strong></em><em>wife</em>”; “<em><strong>saw</strong></em>&#8211;<em>toothed</em>”
                                tiger; “<em><strong>rosy</strong></em>&#8211;<em>fingered</em> dawn” (<em>rhododaktylos
                                    Êôs </em>“<em><strong>cow</strong></em>&#8211;<em>eyed</em>” (<em>boôpis</em>) Hera,

                                In Plato’s <em>Theaetetus</em> 7 Protagoras says: “But when you talk of pigs and
                                dog-faced baboons, <em>you</em> not only <em>act like a pig</em> yourself
                                (<em>autos</em> <em><strong>hyên</strong></em><em>eis</em>), but you persuade your

                        <h4>7. Words for Simile in Greek</h4>

                        <div>
                            <p>7§1. The word <em>eikôn</em> in the passages quoted in the Compendium often has a meaning
                                more general than that signified by ‘simile’, although it includes that meaning as well.
                                At <em>Gorgias</em> 493d Socrates begins to construct another illustration (<em>allên
                                    eikona</em>) “from the same school as the first” (<em>ek tou autou gymnasiou têi
                                    nûn</em>) about two men with jars, one of whom has to keep filling his because of
                                leaks.” Another example at <em>Laws</em> 10.3.898a–b: “We could never say that we were
                                unskilled creators of fair images (<em>kalôn eikonôn</em>) in speech.” Also at <em>Phaedo</em>
                                7 Cebes says: “I too like Simmias need some ‘figure’ (<em>eikonos tinos</em> = a simile
                                or analogy), as it appears. It seems to me this could be said equally well, just as
                                someone might say about an elderly weaver who had died that he was still alive
                                somewhere, offering as proof the cloak that he had woven was still whole and had not
                                perished (87b–c) … and I think the same analogy (<em>eikona</em>) would apply to the
                                soul and the body” (87d).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>7§2. At <em>Phaedrus</em> 6 Socrates uses a verbal form to refer to a simile: “Concerning
                                the soul’s form this much may be said. To tell what it really is would require a long
                                discourse, but it is within human power to describe it briefly <em>in a figure</em>
                                (<em>hôi de eoiken</em>). Let it be compared to (<em>eoiketô</em>) the composite power
                                of a winged yoke of horses and a charioteer” (246a; more at 253d ff.).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>7§3. In the <em>Republic</em> the references to comparison are general: at
                                <em>Republic</em> 2.5 Socrates says that “we have lost sight of the comparison (<em>eikonos</em>)
                                that we set before ourselves” (375d). Shortly after this (<em>Republic</em> 2.6) he uses
                                the verb <em>eikazein</em> clearly with the meaning of a painter trying to reproduce
                                someone’s likeness: “when one portrays badly (<em>eikazêi tis kakôs</em>) … like a
                                painter (<em>graphôs</em>) etc.” (377e). At <em>Republic</em> 3.2 Socrates uses the verb
                                <em>apeikazô</em>: “If we likened (<em>apeikazontes</em>) that kind of food and regimen
                                to music and song … it would be a fair comparison (<em>orthôs apeikazoimen</em>).”
                                (404d-e) Again at <em>Republic</em> 6.5 the noun <em>eikôn</em> is used but the sense is
                                general: “You ask a question, I said, in need of an answer expressed <em>by an
                                    image</em> (<em>di’ eikonos</em> [comparison, parable or simile]).” As discussed at
                                <em>Republic</em> 6.5, this passage illustrates the general meaning of <em>eikôn</em>
                                referring to a more extensive comparison.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>7§4. At the beginning of Book Seven (<em>Republic</em> 7.1) the verb <em>apeikazô</em> is
                                again used by Socrates as a preamble to what we normally call an allegory: &#8220;After
                                this I said, ‘Imagine an allegory of [literally, compare to such an experience: <em>apeikason
                                    tosoutôi pathei</em>] our nature with regard to education and ignorance. Now picture
                                (<em>ide</em>) humans as (<em>hoîon</em>) [people living] in an underground cave.”
                                (514a) Although the last sentence is formed as a simile with a <em>prothesis</em> (<em>hoîon</em>),
                                the description that follows is long enough to be considered an allegory. After
                                Socrates’ description Glaucon remarks (<em>Republic</em> 7.2): “A strange image /
                                picture / allegory /parable (<em>eikona</em>) you speak of … and strange prisoners.”
                                (515a) Here the <em>eikôn</em> is referring to what we would call an allegory. In his
                                summary paragraph (<em>Republic</em> 7.3) Socrates tells Glaucon to apply “this image
                                (<em>eikona</em>) … to all that has been said, likening (<em>aphomoioûnta</em>) the
                                region revealed through sight to the habitation of the prison and the light of the fire
                                in it to the power of the sun.” (517a-b) At <em>Republic</em> 7.13 (531b) Socrates uses
                                <em>eikôn</em> again with the general sense of ‘comparison’: “Not to draw out the
                                comparison (<em>eikôn</em>) [of torturing slaves on the rack and tuning a lyre] I drop
                                the figure (<em>tês eikonos</em>).” Cf. 489a (Book VI): “You do not require us to put
                                the comparison to the proof (<em>exetazomenên tên eikona ideîn</em>).” At
                                <em>Republic</em> 9.4 (588b) Socrates wants to create a summary image of the soul: “Let
                                us carry on the discussion by creating an image (<em>eikona</em>) of the soul so that
                                the speaker may know what he said.”</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>7§5. In Alcibiades’ speech at <em>Symposium</em> 588b [<em>Symposium</em> 13–14] the word
                                <em>eikôn</em> is used in the sense of <em>simile</em>: “I am going to try to praise
                                Socrates … through images (= similes, <em>eikonôn</em>) … and the purpose of the
                                comparison (<em>hê eikôn</em>) will be to tell the truth, not to ridicule.” Then he
                                compares Socrates specifically to Silenuses and the satyr Marsyas: “<em>he</em> [<em>Socrates</em>]
                                is most similar to (<em>homoiotaton</em>) those Silenuses sitting in the statuaries’
                                shops … and he is like (<em>eoikenai</em>) the satyr Marsyas.” These examples show that,
                                although the verbs <em>apeikazô</em> and <em>eoiken</em> regularly introduced similes,
                                the noun <em>eikôn</em> was used most often in a general sense and only rarely had the
                                specific meaning of ‘simile’.</p>

                            <p>7§6. Citing D. F. Ast’s <em>Lexicon Platonicum</em> (Berlin 1908), which lists more than
                                sixty passages containing the word <em>eikôn</em>, Marsh finds that only three or four
                                refer narrowly to simile (p. 12): “Of the four instances in which the term refers at
                                least in part to simile, all but one (the <em>Symposium</em> passage) allow in fact
                                considerable latitude of meaning. More than a dozen other instances show <em>eikôn</em>
                                in an unambiguous sense of ‘illustration,’ ‘image,’ or ‘comparison.’ This is certainly
                                Plato’s understanding of the term.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-31">31</a>] <a

                                lexicons by Ast, Brandwood and Radice, it became clear that similes are associated with
                                a large variety of words that can only be recognized in context (as explained in the
                                Introduction). Perhaps some analogies are appropriate here. If you think of fishing, you
                                can never know how many more fish are left in the pond after you have caught thirty. If
                                you use the analogy of sampling a population the way pollsters do to get some idea of
                                social trends, you will find that the occurrence of similes is by no means regular
                                enough to predict how many there might be in an entire work if you find ten, for
                                example, in the first fifty pages. A glance at the Simile Distribution Chart C will show
                                how they occur in clusters that are by no means predictable. So the sampling technique
                                would not work for similes. A third analogy might be closer to the reality: counting
                                goldfish in a large murky basin. You can see most of them, although you might miss a few
                                because of the dark water and there are also other fish that appear similar.</p>

                            <p>8§2. Now that we have amassed a considerable collection of similes in Plato’s Dialogues,
                                we must discuss briefly the problem of distinguishing this group from other similar
                                examples. In other words, what criteria were used to include some quotations and exclude
                                others? On the basis of the traditional definition of “an explicit comparison of two
                                essentially unlike things” (or a <em>figurative</em> comparison), it seemed appropriate
                                to exclude <strong>three types of comparative constructions: definitions, examples and
                                    factual information</strong>. “<em>Crete</em> is not a level country
                                <strong>like</strong> (<em>kathaper</em>) <em><strong>Thessaly </strong></em>(<em>hê tôn
                                    Thettalôn</em>)” [<em>Laws</em> 625d]; or “in a <em>country</em>
                                <strong>like</strong> <em><strong>Crete</strong></em>” [<em>Laws</em> 8.834b]; “Homer’s
                                <em>Iliad</em> is a <strong>finer</strong> poem <strong>than</strong> his
                                <em>Odyssey</em>” (<em>Hippias Minor</em> 363b). In form these statements appear to be
                                similes but the vehicle is merely factual and informative, not figurative.</p>

                                vehicle may seem factual rather than figurative: “<em>You</em> <strong>are</strong> a
