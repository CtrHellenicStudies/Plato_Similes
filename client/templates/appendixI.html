                                <h1><em>Tenors</em> in the Platonic Similes</h1>
                                <h2>A. General Observations</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>1. Since one of the functions of similes is to illustrate abstract subjects and make them more familiar, <strong>abstract tenors</strong> are numerous and varied: custom, death, democracy, desires, greediness, ideas, injustice, knowledge, law, life, love, memories, (human) nature, opinions, philosophy, pleasure and pain, sex, sickness, soul, the state, the <em>technê</em> of speaking, virtue, war and wisdom. In medical discussions, on the other hand, terms to be explained are <strong>concrete</strong>, as in the <em>Timaeus</em> (bile, blood vessels, body, fetus, genitals), and comparisons help to clarify their functions. The tenors that have the most examples are child(ren), laws, <em>logoi</em> (‘arguments’), love(r), soul and ‘Socrates’ (because he was the main character in most Dialogues). Some topics that you might expect to serve as tenors, like <em>Eros</em>, for example, (or <em>arete</em>, dialectic, <em>episteme</em>, rhetoric) do not appear more than once or twice. ‘Lover’ and ‘beloved’ serve as tenors for comparison, but not the abstract ‘love’ or ‘desire’ (more than once or twice).</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>2. Similes help to make the tenors more vivid by comparison with other things (vehicles) but if they are already familiar (like famous personalities) then the similes often add humor (e.g. Socrates as a gadfly or rooster). <strong>Personal names</strong> mentioned as <em>tenors</em> are primarily the participants in the Dialogues: Callicles, Charmides, Critias, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, Euthyphro, Meletus, Parmenides, Phaedrus, Protagoras, Socrates, Theaetetus, Thrasymachus, Timaeus; with brief references to Bias, Daedalus, Pericles’ children, Simonides and Zeus.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>3. In Sections ‘B–G’ we will examine the similes about <strong>Socrates</strong>, the <strong>soul</strong>, <strong><em><span class="bi">logos</span></em></strong>, <strong>law<em> </em></strong>(from the <em>Laws</em>), <strong>justice</strong> (from the <em>Republic</em>), and the <strong>gods</strong>. In the following selection the <em>vehicles </em>are presented after the equal (=) sign with abbreviated references to the passages from the Dialogues. Except in a few places (e.g. <em>Symposium</em> 221c–d), the references below are to the listing of similes in the Compendium (e.g. <em>Apology</em> 2).</p>

                                <h2>B. Socrates</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>Alcibiades (<em>Symposium</em> 221c–d) says that the most unusual thing about Socrates is his dis-similarity to anyone else, unlike in this respect to any other famous man from antiquity or in his day. You can compare Brasidas with Achilles or Pericles with Nestor but there’s no one like Socrates. Hence the somewhat paradoxical frequency of similes attempting to portray him.</p>

                                    <p>Comment: The majority of these similes depict Socrates speaking ironically about himself, often humorously and self-effacingly. In contrast to these often amusing personal revelations, it is noteworthy that in the Dialogues featuring other main speakers in place of Socrates (<em>Laws</em>, <em>Sophist</em>, <em>Statesman</em>, <em>Timaeus</em>), we find no such similes about the speakers.</p>

                                    <p>Comment: The soul of course is a very important subject in Plato, represented by a plethora of similes in ten different Dialogues (all here are in the <em>thesis</em> except for <em>Republic</em> 7.11, where it is in the <em>vehicle</em>). In <em>Alcibiades</em> 1 (130) Socrates engages in a discussion about soul with Alcibiades, who is obliged to concur that “either man is nothing at all, or if something, he turns out to be nothing else than soul” and that “the soul is man” (<em>hê psychê estin anthrôpos</em>). As J. Annas says (Annas 2003:65 ff.), there is no one consistent account in the Dialogues and there are conflicting suggestions about the nature of its relation with the body, sometimes the body’s ruler and director (e.g. a god in the sun’s chariot [<em>Laws </em>10.4] or a charioteer [<em>Phaedrus</em> 16]), sometimes its unhappily trapped prisoner (e.g. <em>Phaedrus</em> 8: “we are imprisoned <strong>like</strong> an <strong><em><span class="bi">oyster</span></em></strong>”). Since Socrates uses so many similes in different contexts, the presentation varies according to the situation along with the similes.</p>

                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>One might ask—although we will not presume to answer—what Plato’s conception of the soul would look like without all the similes, since they support the basic ideas of its nature as composite, tripartite and immortal. In contrast to his presentation in the Dialogues, for example, Aristotle’s treatise (<em>De anima</em>) is in a lecture format with a much more varied presentation of argument, definition, examples, quotations from previous philosophers, questions, syllogisms (425b28), in addition to similes: e.g. “the soul cannot be separated from the body … It is also uncertain (<em>adêlon</em>) whether the soul bears the same relation to the body (<em>ei houtôs entelecheia toû sômatos hê psychê</em>) <strong>as</strong> the <em><span class="bi"><strong>sailor to the ship</strong> </span></em>(<em>hôsper plôtêr ploiou</em>)” (2.413a4–9); “the faculty of sensation (<em>to aisthêtikon</em>) … <strong>like</strong><em> </em><em><span class="bi"><strong>fuel</strong> </span></em>(<em>kathaper to kausto</em>) does not burn by itself “ (2.417a7–8); “the soul is <strong>like</strong> the <em><span class="bi"><strong>hand</strong> </span></em>[of a man] (<em>hôsper hê cheir</em>) for the hand is an instrument which employs instruments (<em>organon organôn</em>)” (3.432a1–2). In Plato’s Dialogues the purpose of discussing the soul varies with each situation: in  the <em>Republic</em>, for example, the issue is its relation to justice in the state; in the <em>Phaedo</em> the concern is to consider its immortal nature; in Aristotle’s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, on the other hand, the discussion (1.9.7 and 13.8 to the end of Book I) deals more with an individual’s happiness.</p>
