                                <h1>Other Modes of Comparison</h1>
                                <div class="Paragraph">It is relevant to note that Plato frequently introduces other figures of speech based on comparisons as alternatives to, or in addition to similes: <em>allegories</em>, <em>analogies</em>, <em>paradoxes</em>, <em>proverbs</em>, <em>puns</em>, <em>historical and mythical parallels</em>. This entire arsenal of philological tools is employed to add support to an argument by exploiting similarities that are sometimes surprising, paradoxical and/or humorous. Paradoxes and puns make use of intriguing comparisons while proverbs, myths and historical parallels add authority to similarities between past and present situations. Metaphors are somewhat different since, being less contrived and more natural aspects of dialogue, they lack the didactic aspect of the other figures. Also over-used metaphors in any language become normative secondary meanings of a word.</div>
                                <h2>1. Allegories</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>If similes and analogies are explicit—and usually brief—comparisons and metaphors are more implicit, allegories are extended comparisons and thus may be considered the equivalent to the long similes in Homer (such as those that Aristotle says do not occur in prose).<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-1">1</a>] <a id="noteref_n-1"></a></span> The allegories of the ‘ship of state’ (<em>Republic </em>Book 6 488b–e), the cave (<em>Republic</em> Book 7, 514a) and the soul in the <em>Phaedrus</em> (246a ff.) are familiar examples. Plato uses forms of <em>eikôn</em> (<em>apeikazo</em> at 514a and <em>eikôn</em> at 517a) to describe the long allegory of the cave. The ship of state captained by a deaf shipmaster with poor eyesight (at <em>Republic</em> Book 6, 488) is called an <em>eikôn</em>—the same word used for <em>simile</em> and <em>metaphor</em> (at 488a and 489a, meaning ‘likeness, image, similitude, parable’). Plato famously objected to including certain malicious stories (about the gods) from Homer and Hesiod in his ideal educational system (<em>Republic</em> Book 2, 378d) on the grounds that children cannot distinguish between hidden (<em>hyponoia</em>) and literal meanings and so he banished both poets from that curriculum. This is the basis for imposing a censorship on story-makers, approving what they do well and rejecting the opposite (377b–c). As for translating the word <em>eikôn</em> in these places as ‘parable’ or ‘allegory’ instead of ‘simile’, we note both the length of the comparisons as well as the fact that in introducing the ship imagery Socrates says that he uses this type of comparison sparingly, whereas (as we have seen) he includes brief similes frequently, without referring to them as ‘similes’. This is a further indication that what we have been calling ‘similes’ probably had no specific word in Greek. Also in allegories it is not always clear what the specific comparison is. For example, in the ‘ship of state’ allegory (<em>Republic</em> Book 6, 488b–e) there is some ambiguity about the role of the ‘ship owner’ and the ‘captain’ so that it is not clear which figure refers to philosophers. Is ‘the navigator’ (<em>nauklêros</em>) the <em>dêmos</em>, as Aristotle (<em>Rhetoric</em> III 4, 1406<sup>b</sup>35) and some modern translators claim, or the true philosophers, as the text would seem to indicate.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-2">2</a>] <a id="noteref_n-2"></a></span>In the simile that concludes this allegory (489c) present rulers are compared to the sailors and useless stargazers to true navigators. In similes the <em>tenor</em> and <em>vehicle</em> are always explicit.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>Similarly, in the allegory of the cave at the beginning of Book Seven the word <em>eikôn</em> is used in a more extensive way. At 514a Plato uses verbal forms: ‘imagine’ (<em>apeikason</em>) and ‘<em>see</em> (<em>ide</em>) men <em>as</em> (<em>hoion</em>) in an underground cave-like dwelling …” Glaucon says that it is a <em>strange</em> <em>image</em> (515a: <em>atopon</em> … <em>eikona</em>). Socrates assures him that they are ‘like us’ (<em>homoious</em> <em>hêmîn</em>). Again the allegories are longer and less explicit than most similes. This is true also of the comparison of the soul to a winged chariot (at <em>Phaedrus</em> 246aff) although there, as we have seen, numerous similes are also included.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h2>2. Analogies</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>Socrates’ habit of frequently referring to farmers, businessmen, craftsmen and other specialists such as wrestling masters, harpists, etc., is similar to his use of similes. In both strategies an abstract process of thought is made clearer by reference to concrete, familiar and often amusing subjects, except that analogies do not usually have the format of tenors, <em>protheses</em> and vehicles. These comparisons are made to reinforce a point that Socrates wants to make (e.g., specialists have expertise only in their own specialties). Sometimes the only formal difference between such analogies and similes is the lack of the word ‘like’, although at <em>Lovers</em> 135b–c even this word is provided to introduce the analogy of carpentry (<em>hôsper en têi</em> <em>tektonikêi</em>); and in analogies the comparisons are more mundane, realistic and factual. In the <em>Timaeus</em> (31c and 32b) the relationship between the four basic elements (earth, fire, air and water) of the universe is determined by <em>analogia</em> or ‘mathematical proportion’, which is different from the English derivative ‘analogy’, defined as a ‘similarity between things that are otherwise dissimilar’. The English meaning is closer to the Greek word <em>eikazô</em> (<em>to compare or to infer from comparison, that is, to form a conjecture</em>), as used at <em>Meno</em> 98b when Socrates distinguishes <em>knowing</em> from <em>conjecturing</em>: &#8220;I really don&#8217;t say this from knowledge but from conjecture (<em>egô hôs ouk eidôs legô, all&#8217; eikazôn</em>).” He is thus making what we would call an analogy between true opinions and the statues of Daedalus or runaway slaves (see <em>Meno</em> 97d–e). Another example may be found at <em>Republic</em> Book 4, 429d, where Socrates says, &#8220;If I may use an analogy (<em>ethelo apeikasai</em>),&#8221; and then compares the moral training of guardians to dyeing wool.Plato’s most famous analogy no doubt is his comparison of the individual to the state in his search for justice (<em>Republic</em> Book 2, 368e; Book 5, 472c). Without using the word, Socrates gives a string of analogies starting at <em>Theages</em> 123B, when he compares educational instruction to the <em>Sophistia</em> (or wisdom) of governing a team of horses, steering a ship, healing the sick, training gymnasts, etc. Socrates often introduces analogous professions when he wants to illustrate similarities between activities <em>en</em> <em>route</em> to challenging an opponent’s line of reasoning.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-3">3</a>] </span> <a id="noteref_n-3"></a> See also his example of a painter who leaves a successor to repair and improve his painting after his death as an analogy for a Lawsgiver (<em>Laws</em> 6, Intro). Further details on the analogies cited in the Dialogues are listed here:</p>

                                <h3>Professions Cited by Socrates</h3>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>Since analogies are by far the most common ways of introducing parallel situations in Socrates&#8217; philosophical discussions, it will be helpful to document this practice in order to confirm just how prevalent it is. At <em>Gorgias</em> 491 Callicles criticizes Socrates for always talking about <em>cobblers</em>, <em>cooks</em> and <em>doctors</em>. (Cf. Alcibiades in the <em>Symposium</em> 221e.) Why does Socrates do this? He makes a distinction between the sphere of specialists and the pursuit of wisdom. All specialists have a special skill confined to their field, but Socrates says that no <em>technê</em> can make a man wise. Only <em>epistêmê</em> (knowledge) can do this. Nevertheless, for specific questions, one should always consult an expert. At least nineteen of Plato’s Dialogues include this <em>topos</em>, which is analogous to similes since comparisons are made between the various specialties.</p>

In what subject does rhetoric make men better? At 451–452 the chain of thought is like a simile in that Socrates uses other examples to illustrate to Gorgias what he is asking him regarding the ‘work’ (<em>ergon</em>) of rhetoricians: the arts of numeration at 451a–c (<em>hê arithmêtikê</em>), calculation (<em>logistikê</em>) and astronomy (<em>astronomia</em>) and at 452a–c the doctor (<em>iatros</em>), trainer (<em>paidotribês</em>) and money-getter (<em>chrêmatistês</em>). According to Gorgias the ‘work’ of rhetoric is persuasion (<em>peithous dêmiourgos estin hê rhêtorikê</em>). To show that rhetoric is not the only producer of ‘persuasiveness’ Socrates examines the example of the painter Zeuxis (453c–d). At 464b Socrates again introduces several analogies to conclude with a correspondence or ‘geometric proportion’ (<em>hôsper hoi</em> <em>geômetrai</em> 465b) between the arts (465c): as self-adornment (<em>ho kommôtikê</em>) is to gymnastic (<em>gymnastikê</em>), so sophistry (<em>sophistikê</em>) is to legislation (<em>nomothetikên</em>); and as cookery (<em>opsopoiikê</em>) is to medicine (<em>iatrikê</em>) so rhetoric (<em>rhêtorikê</em>) is to justice (<em>dikaiosynê</em>). At 501e the analogy is introduced by the familiar similetic prothesis (<em>hoîon</em>): “And so too <em>all similar pursuits</em>, <strong>such as</strong> <strong><em>harp-playing</em></strong> (<em>kitharistikê</em>).” Thus the logic of analogy and comparison plays an important role in this Dialogue.</p>

                                <div class="Paragraph">In a paradox two assertions that are surprising or contradictory are brought into close association in spite of their apparent dissimilarity, for example, when Socrates says that it is a greater evil to do wrong than to suffer it (<em>Gorgias</em> 469c; 527b). The noun <em>paradoxos</em> (&#8216;contrary to expectation&#8217;) is not found in Plato’s writings but a little further on in the same Dialogue (<em>Gorgias</em> 473a) when Polus accuses Socrates of advancing strange things [<em>atopa</em>] in defending this assertion, it would be natural to add “paradox” in translation.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-4">4</a>]  </span><a id="noteref_n-4"></a>The most familiar paradox in Plato is his assertion (at <em>Republic</em> Book 5, 473c–d: &#8220;perhaps the most famous sentence in Plato&#8221;<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-5">5</a>]</span><a id="noteref_n-5"></a>) that there would be no real peace or freedom in Greece until &#8220;philosophers become kings or kings philosophers.&#8221; In the next sentence (473e) Socrates uses the prepositional phrase <em>para </em><em>doxan</em> (“contrary to belief”) in our sense of ‘paradoxical’ to explain why he had hesitated, because he realized “that it would be a very paradoxical thing to say.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-6">6</a>] </span><a id="noteref_n-6"></a> Other examples of &#8216;paradox&#8217; may be found (a) in the <em>Republic</em> (<em>thaumastotaton akousai</em> and <em>atopon</em>) where the gifts of nature that we praise (bravery, sobriety, etc.) tend to corrupt the soul of their possessor and divert it from philosophy (<em>ta legomena agatha phtheirei</em> at <em>Republic</em> Book 6, 491b–c); <span style="line-height: 1.5em">(b) in Heraclitus’ obscure saying (quoted by Eryximachus at </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">Symposium</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> 187a) about the One differing yet agreeing with itself </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">(</span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">diapheromenon auto hautôi sympheresthai</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em">); (c) in the paradoxical simile </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">spoken by the Elean Visitor: “a wolf is very similar to a dog, the wildest to the </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">mildest of animals” (</span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">Sophist</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> 231a); and (d) “nothing can harm a good person </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">in life or in death (</span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">Apology</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> 41d).

                                <h2>4. Proverbs and Aphorisms</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">Proverbs (<em>paroimiai</em>), aphorisms (<em>gnômai</em>), myths and historical stories often draw attention to the similarities between two situations, the current one and a more famous former or theoretical one that throws light on the current situation. When Socrates quotes Homer (<em>Iliad</em> 10, 223) at <em>Protagoras</em> 348d and near the beginning of the <em>Symposium</em> (174d: &#8220;two heads are better than one&#8221;), it does not clarify the discussion so much as add a dash of elegance to it. It is really just a decoration. Sometimes an aphorism gives authority to a context, even when no source is given, as at <em>Philebus</em> 20e: &#8220;Let there be no wisdom in the life of pleasure and no pleasure in the life of wisdom.&#8221; Often a proverb is tagged as such (<em>Laches</em> 187b): “If this is your first attempt at education, you must be careful not to begin ‘on the Carian’ but on your own sons and your friends’ children, lest the saying appropriately fit you according to the proverb (<em>atechnôs to legomenon kata tên paroimian</em>) of ‘learning pottery on a vase’” Here both an idiom (‘on the Carian’) and a proverb (<em>paroimia</em>) are included. At <em>Sophist</em> 231c the Stranger quotes an appropriate proverb (<em>paroimia</em>) for the context which says that it is not easy to escape all [the wrestler’s grips] (<em>to tas hapases mê thâidion eînai epitheteon diaphygein</em>). Sometimes the quotation is attributed to someone: “as Solon said” (<em>kata to tou Solônos</em> at <em>Laches</em> 188b). Plato quotes, adapts or alludes to many literary passages in his Dialogues, both known and unidentified. The story of Gyges (<em>Republic</em> Book 2, 359d) is an example of a myth told to illustrate the kind of license (<em>exousia</em>) people would have without justice, where a magic ring (<em>chrysoun dactylion</em>) gives one the power to act without being seen. The myths of Alcestis and Achilles are parallel stories that Phaedrus cites (<em>Symposium</em> 179b) as noble examples of what people in love will do (i.e., die for another). These stories are added to illustrate a point made in the narrative. Aristophanes&#8217; story about the <em>androgyne</em> (<em>Symposium</em> 189dff.) is not a traditional myth but a fictional creation to describe the original nature of man. Unlike a story already well-known to the audience, Aristophanes&#8217; myth is unfamiliar and perhaps for that reason it is adorned with several clarifying similes: they moved by rolling <em>like tumblers</em>; they will hop <em>like revelers on wineskins</em>; Zeus sliced them <em>like eggs</em>; he pulled the skin together at the navel <em>like purses</em>.</div>
                                <h2>5. Puns</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">Like paradoxes, puns also are found in the text of Plato, although the word itself (<em>paragrammatizô</em>, to alter by changing a letter) is not. This kind of word play exploits (a) the close association of two words of different meaning that sound alike or (b) different meanings of the same word. We offer a few examples here since, like similes, puns depend on seeing similarities between extraneous subjects. Socrates makes a pun on feasting and dialectic at <em>Republic</em> Book 1, 354a–b, where he alludes to Thrasymachus&#8217;s previous reference to their discussion (&#8220;Let this complete your entertainment [<em>hestiastho</em>], Socrates”) by replying &#8220;but I have not feasted well (<em>ou mentoi kalôs ge heistiamai</em>).&#8221; Punning on names is found in Book Ten of the <em>Republic</em> in the tale (<em>Apology</em>) of Er, beginning with Alcinous&#8217; name derived from an adjective of similar sound (614b: <em>Alkinou</em> … <em>alkimou andros</em>). Word play is also cited by Shorey in connection with Ariston’s name in Book Nine (580b).<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-8">8</a>]  </span><a id="noteref_n-8"></a>Other examples may be observed in the passage of the <em>Gorgias</em> (493a) where Socrates says that the <em>sôma</em> (body) is really a tomb (<em>sêma</em>) and that some clever man mythologizing (<em>mythologôn</em>) and punning on the name (<em>paragôn toi onomati</em>) called it a <em>pithon</em> (cask) from its being <em>pithanon</em> (credulous), but he called the <em>anoiêtoi </em>(foolish) <em>amuêtoi</em> (uninitiated). An example from the <em>Symposium</em>, so rich in puns, is in Aristophanes’ account (at 190d) of Zeus slicing the early humans in half like people cutting sorb-apples (<em>hôsper hoi to </em><em><strong><span class="bi">oa</span></strong></em>) or eggs (<em>hôsper hoi ta </em><em><strong><span class="bi">ôa</span></strong></em>). Reeve points out Socrates’ punning statement (177a7–8) that the only thing he knows is the art of ‘erotics’ (<em>erôtika</em>) when he means ‘asking questions’ (<em>erôtan</em>) rathen than ‘love’ (<em>erôs</em>).<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-9">9</a>]  </span>At <em>Hipparchus</em> 225e Socrates acknowledges his pun on the words for “season and soil” (<em>hôra kai chôra</em>) by calling them “one of those clever phrases (<em>tôn Sophistôn rheumatôn</em>) which adroit pleaders (<em>hoi dexioi</em>) use to dress up (<em>kalliepoûntai</em>) their speeches in the Laws courts.” At <em>Phaedrus</em> 252c Socrates quotes two verses from a spurious poem of Homer that play on the word for Love: “Mortals call him winged Love (<em>Erôta</em>), but the Immortals call him The Winged One (<em>Pterôta</em>), because he must needs grow wings.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-10">10</a>] </span><a id="noteref_n-10"></a>Also note the ironic pun in <em>Republic</em> Book 3 (406b): “After a long life tortured by disease, struggling against death because of his science he [Herodicus] arrived at <em>old age</em> (<em>gêras</em>). (Socrates) <strong><em>A fine prize </em></strong>(<em>kalon geras</em>) indeed for his skill.” (Glaucus) These examples illustrate type <em>a</em> above (words that sound alike) except for the first quotation from <em>Republic</em> Book One, where two meanings of the word ‘feast’ are employed (eating and conversing). This type of pun—clever and humorous but apparently less common in Plato—exploits the metaphorical meaning along with the literal meaning of a word.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-11">11</a>] </span><br />
                                    <a id="noteref_n-11"></a></div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>We have noted the remarkable punning description (<em>lelumenou</em>/freed … <em>leloumenou</em>/washed) at <em>Republic</em> 6.10 (495e) as well as the pun implied by the proverb of ‘falling off a donkey’ (<em>apo</em> … <em>onou</em>) for ‘speaking out of one’s mind’ (<em>apo nou</em> at <em>Laws </em>3.2). Shortly after this passage another example of alliteration occurs at 685a: <em>peri nomôn paizontas paidian presbutikên sôphrona</em> (“indulging in an old man’s sober play with Laws” at <em>Laws</em> 3, 685a). At <em>Protagoras</em> 10 Alcibiades addresses Callias with a pun on his name: “You do not state the matter well (<em>kalôs</em>), Callias (<em>ô Kallia</em>).” Again we may note Plato’s use of alliteration for comic effect at <em>Statesman</em> 6 (268e): <em>Panu proseche ton noûn kathaper hoi paîdes: pantôs ou polla ekpheugeis paidias etê</em> (‘Please pay careful attention like children: anyway you are not much too old for children’s tales’). Also note alliteration near the beginning of <em>Epinomis</em> (973c–d): <em>kai teleutêsas teleutês toiautês tuchein</em> (‘and in death to find such a [noble] end’).</p>

                                <h2>6. Myths and Historical Parallels</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">The frequent quotations from Homer and other poets are also like similes in that a parallel story is cited to improve the argument. At the conclusion of <em>Alcibiades</em> II (151b), for example, the comparison is introduced by the familiar formulaic word <em>hôsper</em> (&#8220;<em>As</em> Euripides has made Kreon say&#8221;). Then comes a quotation about a good omen, after which Socrates says that he too takes Alcibiades’ opinion as a good omen. Thus many quotations perform the same function as similes. Sometimes Plato tells even more specifically why the story is included. After narrating the myth of Atreus and Thyestes to illustrate the revolution of the universe in the opposite direction (<em>Statesman</em> 269–274), the Visitor says (275b): &#8220;That is why I introduced this myth, to show that all men compete for the care of the flock and to see more clearly the one who ought to have the care of human beings as shepherds care for their flocks.&#8221; The inclusion of a mythological reference to clarify the logic is illustrated at <em>Alcibiades</em> II 144a, where Socrates says, “Suppose you wanted to kill your friend Pericles, but did not know him—or Orestes his mother but did not recognize her …” Here a familiar myth is brought in to illustrate the importance of knowledge versus ignorance. Historical stories are also introduced for the same reason as myths. The <em>Laws</em> reflect on history much more than those starring Socrates, who did not often include historical parallels, except in the <em>Menexenus</em>, which ironically has Socrates narrating history for several decades after the period of his own death (presumably to illustrate the unreliability of funeral orators).<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-12">12</a>]  </span><a id="noteref_n-12"></a>Fables are used in a similar way, as in the fable of Aesop (at <em>Alcibiades</em> I, 123a: <em>atechnôs kata ton Aisôpou mython</em>) where the fox remarks to the lion on the direction of the footprints. This is cited by Socrates in reference to the traces of money going into Lacedaimon which are clear enough, but nowhere are any to be seen coming out.</div>
                                <h2>7. Metaphors</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">It is commonly assumed that similes and metaphors are both figures of comparison. Metaphors, however, strictly speaking do not compare things because the subject of the comparison is not stated, whereas in similes the comparison is explicit. It is very difficult, for example, to describe looks, sounds, feelings, smells and other impressions of our sense organs. Therefore in these areas similes are useful and common. Meno’s comparison of Socrates to a torpedo fish gives a humorous picture of his appearance: “If I may jest (<em>skôpsai</em>),] <em>you</em> seem to me to be in appearance (<em>eidos</em>) and other aspects <strong>most like</strong> (<em>homoiotatos</em>) a <strong><em>flat torpedo sea-fish/electric ray</em></strong> (<em>tautêi têi plateiai napkêi têi thalattiai</em>).” (<em>Meno</em> 80a) Most similes in Plato—most of Socrates’ similes—however, do not illustrate this difficulty in describing sense impressions, but rather elucidate the argument. Metaphors, on the other hand, are not introduced for the sake of explicit comparison; instead they depend upon the common linguistic heritage with the audience to engage in colloquial or even poetic language when a literal expression seems unsatisfactory: e.g., offering ‘an olive branch’ instead of an offer of peace; <em>catching fire</em> instead of <em>feeling lust</em> (Socrates in <em>Charmides</em> 155d); speaking of the <em>creation </em>of a new country in terms of <em>birth </em>(Abraham Lincoln’s metaphor in his <em>Gettysburg Address</em>).</div>

                                    <p>(a) At the conclusion of <em>Republic</em> Book 1 (354a–b: <em>Republic</em> 1.11), a metaphor is <em>part of Socrates’ humor</em>, when he refers to the dialectic as a feast or entertainment (<em>hestiasis</em>), punning on Thrasymachus&#8217;s previous statement (&#8220;Let this complete your entertainment [<em>hestiastho</em>], Socrates, at the festival of Bendis.&#8221;): &#8220;but I have not<br />
                                        feasted well (<em>ou mentoi kalôs ge heistiamai</em>).&#8221; This notion of a discussion as a feast is found again at <em>Sophist</em> 251b where the Eleatic Visitor states: &#8220;Whence we have provided <em>a feast</em> for the young and the late-learners among the old.&#8221; Here the allusion to the “discussion” a few sentences earlier may allow us to consider this a simile (<em>Sophist</em> 8). Typically, however, metaphors cannot be changed into similes merely by the addition of a single prothetic word because the difference is usually more than phraseology and it is left to the audience to supply the <em>tenor</em> by understanding that ‘feast’ stands for ‘discussion.’</p>

In 457e he refers to the &#8216;coalition of arguments&#8217; (<em>logôn xysstasin</em>) he must face; his intention of &#8216;running away&#8217; (<em>apodrasesthai</em>) from one of the arguments with Glaukon indicating that he had not &#8216;escaped detection&#8217; (<em>ouk elathes</em> … <em>apodidraskôn</em>); and the necessity of &#8216;paying a penalty&#8217; (<em>uphekteon</em>). A more straight-forward expression is the metaphor of pregnancy at <em>Symposium </em>206c: “All humans are pregnant (<em>kuousi</em>) in body and soul.”</p>

                                    <p>Metaphors are found in the introduction to the discussion of guardians in Book 5 of the <em>Republic</em> (450b), a book which is highly metaphoric. &#8216;You don&#8217;t realize what a swarm (<em>oson </em><em>hesmon</em>) of arguments (<em>logôn</em>) you are stirring up (<em>epegeirete</em>) by this demand.&#8217; (450b) A little later (453d) come the metaphors of swimming to escape the sea of arguments, of the &#8216;unripe fruit of laughter&#8217;, of escaping the &#8216;waves&#8217; of our paradox (457b), of taking a holiday and feasting on their own thoughts (458a), of war as sickness (Greece is sick [<em>nosein</em>] at 470c), of stripping and arming (474a). Metaphors are used here as stylistic enhancements rather than clarifying illustrations.</p>

                                    <p>To illustrate further the difference between metaphor and simile we turn to two English metaphorical expressions commonly used in current political discussion about the bad USA economy and various solutions that do not work: “kicking the can down the road” and “moving the deck chairs around on the Titanic.” For example, someone might say, “if we keep moving the deck chairs around, nothing will be solved.” Here only the vehicle is expressed so that one must infer what is meant. On the other hand, if someone says about a particular proposal, “<em>That’s</em> just [<strong>like</strong>] <strong><em>moving deck chairs around on the Titanic</em></strong>,” the tenor is expressed (this proposal) and we have a simile, whether the word “like” is stated or not. Another example: Someone expecting to be asked to be Vice-President says “I’m waiting in the<br />
                                        wings”; only if we add the words “like an actor” would this metaphor become a simile (“I am waiting to be asked like an actor waiting in the <em>wings</em> of the stage”); and typically one does not add the phrase because the implied comparison is assumed to be familiar to the person addressed.</p>
