                        <p><b> </b></p>
                        <p><b>Alcibiades I </b>(St II.103a–135e) = W. R. M. Lamb, LCL 1964 (1927) [Plato XII]</p>
                        <p><i>The essence of politics.</i></p>
                        <p>1. Alcibiades said that the Athenians and other Greeks rarely deliberate about the just versus the unjust course of action—such a question would be obvious—but rather which is more expedient (<i>ta sympheronta</i>). Socrates then replies that Alcibiades thinks he needs to hear new arguments (<i>kaina atta</i>) and different proofs (<i>apodeixeis heteras</i>), “as though (<i>hôs</i>) the <i>earlier ones</i> (<i>tôn proterôn</i> [<i>logou</i>]) were <b>like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) a <b><i>worn-out coat</i></b> (<i>skeuariôn katatetrimmenôn</i>)” which he refuses to wear any more. (113d–e) Socrates [previous arguments = a worn-out coat]</p>
                        <p>2. “The men who manage the city strike me as uneducated (<i>apaideutoi</i>) … I suppose that anyone who tried to contend with (<i>antagônizesthai</i>) <i>educated managers</i> would have to get some knowledge and practice first, <b>as</b> (<i>hôs</i>) he would for a match with <b><i>athletes</i></b> (<i>ep’ athlêtas</i>).” (119b) Alcibiades [educated city managers = athletes] Alcibiades continues: “… as it is, I think my natural powers alone will give me an easy victory over them.” To which Socrates exclaims, “O my, what a thing to say! How unworthy of your looks and other advantages!” (119c)</p>
                        <p>3. “But really (<i>atechnôs</i>) <b>just as in</b> Aesop’s [fable] (<i>kata ton Aisôpou</i>)<i> </i>the remark (<i>mython</i>) which the fox (<i>alôpêx</i>) made to the lion (<i>leonta</i>) also is true of <i>money going into Lacedaimon</i>, (<i>tou eis Lakedaimona nomismatos eisiontos</i>) that the <b><i>tracks </i></b>(<i>ta ichnê</i>) [of something]<b><i> going in</i></b> are obvious (<i>dêla</i>) but nowhere could one see [the tracks of anything] going out (<i>exionotos</i>).” (123a) Socrates [money into Lacedaimon = tracks into the lion’s den]</p>
                        <p>4–5. I myself was once told by a trustworthy person that he crossed a very <i>large tract of excellent land</i> … which the inhabitants <b>call</b> (<i>kalein</i>) ‘<b><i>the girdle of the king’s wife’</i></b> (<i>zônên tês basileôs gynaikos</i>) and <i>another</i> which was <b>similarly called</b> (<i>kaleisthai</i>) <b><i>‘her veil’</i></b> (<i>kaluptran</i>). (123b) Socrates [excellent land = the girdle of the king’s wife; another tract = her veil]</p>
                        <p>6. “Sir, <i>my</i> <i>love</i> will be <b>in no way</b> <b>different from</b> (<i>ouden dioisei</i>) a <b><i>stork’s</i></b> (<i>pelargou</i>) if, after hatching a winged love in you, it (my love) will be nourished in turn by this<i> </i>(i.e. by a younger stork = love).”<i> </i>(Alcibiades I 135e) Socrates [my love = a stork’s love] Socrates suggests that he will be nourished by the ‘winged love’ that he has implanted in Alcibiades. This is in reply to Alcibiades’ assertion that from this day on he will be always in attendance of Socrates.<b></b></p>
                        <p><b> </b></p>
                        <p><b>Alcibiades II</b> (St II.138a–151c) = W. R. M. Lamb, LCL 1964 (1927) [Plato XII]</p>
                        <p><i>On proper prayer.</i></p>
                        <p>1. “<i>You</i> should be very careful what you pray for so that you do not find yourself praying for great evils, thinking they are good … <b>just as</b><i> </i>(<i>hôsper</i>) <i>they say that <b>Oedipus suddenly prayed</b></i> that his sons divide their patrimony with a sword.” (138b–c) Socrates [you/Alcibiades = Oedipus]</p>
                        <p>2. “For <i>this</i> [praying for one’s own greatest evil] would <i>be </i>truly <b>similar to</b> (<i>homoion</i>) <b><i>some curse</i></b> (<i>katarai tini</i>) <b><i>but not to a prayer </i></b>(<i>euchêi</i>).” (143b) Alcibiades [praying for one’s own evil = a curse (≠ a prayer)]</p>
                        <p>3. “For such is not, I think, the way of the <i>gods</i> to be seduced by gifts <b>like</b> (<i>hoion</i>) an <b><i>evil userer</i></b> (<i>kakon tokistên</i>).” (149e) Socrates [gods ≠ an evil userer]</p>
                        <p>4. “But it seems to me, <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) Homer says that <b><i>Athena removed the mist</i> <i>from Diomedes’ eyes</i> </b>“so that he might recognize both god and man” (Il 5. 127), so <i>you must first have the mist</i> (<i>achlys</i>)<i> removed</i> <i>from your soul</i> … so that you will be able to recognize both evil and good.” (150d–e) Socrates [you &gt; mist from your soul = Athena &gt; mist from Diomedes’ eyes]</p>
                        <p>5. “And <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>Creon</i></b> in Euripides’ play when he sees Teiresias wearing his wreaths … So <i>I </i>take your opinion as a good omen.” (151b) Socrates [I/Socrates = Creon]</p>
                        <p>6. “For <i>I</i> seem to be <b>no less</b> <b>wave-tossed</b> (<i>ouk en elattoni klydôni</i>) <b>than</b> <b><i>Creon</i></b><i> </i>(<i>toû Kreontos</i>) and would like to be victorious over your lovers.” (151c) Socrates [I/Socrates = Creon]</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the final four similes appear in the last two Stephanus pages and are essentially literary references, like the first simile.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><b>Apology</b> (St I.17a–42a) = Harold North Fowler, LCL 1977 (1914) [Plato I]</p>
                        <p><i>Socrates’ defense at his trial.</i></p>
                        <p>1. “But there is need [for <i>me</i>] to <b><i>shadowbox</i></b>, <b>as it were</b>, (<i>hôsper skiamachein</i>) in defending myself and examine him (although) no one (is) answering.” (18d) Socrates [I/Socrates defend = shadow-box]</p>
                        <p>2. “But it is necessary to show you <i>my</i> wandering (<i>planên</i>) <b>as though</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) of someone performing [<b><i>Herculean</i></b>] labors (<i>ponous tinas ponountos</i>), so that the oracle may be proved irrefutable.” (22a) Socrates [I/Socrates = Heracles (implied, as in H. N. Fowler’s translation in the <i>Loeb Classical Library</i>, 1914, 85)] “Socrates casts himself as a latter day Heracles, whose labors are commonly described in Greek literature as <i>ponoi. </i>Note the alliteration” (Miller 2010:49).</p>
                        <p>3. “If you kill <i>me</i>, you will not easily find another such person, as it were—if I may speak somewhat humorously, attached to <i>this city</i> by the god, <b>as though</b> a large and noble <b><i>horse</i></b> (<i>hôsper hippô megalô</i>) lazy because of its size and needing to be waked up by <b><i>some gadfly</i></b> (<i>hypo</i> <i>myôpos</i>). I think the god attached <i>me</i> to <i>this city</i> in some such way.” (30e) Socrates [I/Socrates &gt; Athens = a gadfly &gt; horse]</p>
                        <p>4. “You (<i>hymeîs</i>), <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b>people awakened from a nap</b> (<i>hoi nystazontes egeiromenoi</i>) …” (31a) Socrates [you (Athenians) = people awakened from a nap]</p>
                        <p>5. “<i>I</i> (<i>egô</i>) happen to be <b><i>someone</i></b> (<i>tyngchanô ôn toioûtos</i>)<i> <b>such</b></i><b> as</b> (<i>hoîos</i>) has been <b><i>given to the city by the god</i></b>.” (31a–b) Socrates [I = someone given to Athens by the god]</p>
                        <p>6. “<i>To die</i> (<i>to tethnanai</i>) is either one of two things: either it is <b>like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>being nothing</i></b> (<i>mêden eînai</i>) and having no perception of anything or it is, as people say, <b><i>some change</i></b> (<i>metabolê tis</i>) and <b><i>transplantation</i></b> (<i>metoikêsis</i>) for the soul from here to another place.” (40c) Socrates [death = being nothing or some change and transplantation of the soul] In the next section (40d) he repeats this possibility.</p>
                        <p>7. “And if <i>it </i>[<i>death</i>] is <b><i>unconsciousness</i></b> [<b><i>no perception</i></b>] but <b>like</b> <b><i>sleep</i></b> (<i>hoîon hypnos</i>) when someone sleeping sees not even a dream, then death would be a wonderful gain.” (40d) Socrates [death = sleep]</p>
                        <p>Note that the more colorful similes (1–5) occur in Socrates’ first speech (17–35d), that none occurs in the second (his reaction to the conviction, 35e–38c), and only the bland comparisons of death to some state like sleep or transplantation occur in the third (38c–42a).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><b>Charmides</b> (St II.153a–176d) = W. R. M. Lamb, LCL 1964 (1927) [Plato XII]</p>
                        <p>Socrates has returned from the fighting at Potidaea (432 BC) and gives his friends the news, which is not included in the Dialogue (<i>on </i>sophosyne<i> or temperance</i>).</p>
                        <p>1. “I am nothing to be judged by (<i>stathmêton</i> = a measurer); for <i>I </i><b>am</b> (<i>eimi</i>) <b>actually</b> (<i>atechnôs</i>) <b><i>a white line</i></b> (<i>leukê stathmê</i>) with respect to handsome men, for almost everyone who is in this period of life appears handsome to me.” (154b) Socrates [I/Socrates = a carpenter’s measuring line (therefore useless in marking on white marble)]</p>
                        <p>2. But everyone gazed at <i>him </i>(<i>Charmides</i>) <b>like</b><i> </i>(<i>hôsper = as if he were</i>) <b><i>a statue</i></b> (<i>hôsper agalma</i>). (154c) Socrates [Charmides = a statue]</p>
                        <p>3. “‘(<i>You</i>) beware of coming (<i>elthonta</i>) [<b>as</b>] a <b><i>fawn before a lion</i></b> (<i>leontos nebron</i>) and being seized [as] his portion of flesh.’ For I felt I had fallen a prey to some such creature.” (155d) Socrates quoting the poet Cydias as a warning, when he (Socrates) saw inside Charmides’ cloak and “caught fire” and “lost control of himself”. [you &gt; Charmides = fawn &gt; lion]</p>
                        <p>A common metaphor; see Catullus’ <i>carmen</i> 64.93 for the image of ‘catching fire’, in reference to Ariadne’s passion for Theseus: <i>non prius ex illo flagrantia declinavit</i> / <i>lumina, quam cuncto concepit corpore flammam</i> / <i>funditus atque imis exarsit tota medullis</i>. (Literally: “She did not turn her burning eyes from him until she caught fire deep down in her whole body and was totally ablaze in her inmost marrow.”)</p>
                        <p>4. But <i>he</i> (Critias) seemed to have become as angry with him (Charmides)<i> </i><b>as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>)<i> <b>a poet</b> </i>(<i>poiêtês</i>) <b><i>with an actor</i></b><i> </i>(<i>hypocritêi</i>) <b><i>who delivers his verses badly</i></b>. (162d) Socrates [Critias &gt; Charmides = a poet &gt; an actor]</p>
                        <p>5. When Critias saw me in difficulty, <i>he</i> seemed to me—<b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) the<i> <b>sight of someone yawning</b></i><b> <i>causes people to be affected in a similar way</i></b>—to be compelled by the sense of my difficulty to be caught in difficulty (<i>aporia</i>) himself. (169c) Socrates [Critias &gt; me = people &gt; (seeing) someone yawning]</p>
                        <p><b> </b></p>
                        <p><b>Cleitophon</b> (St III.406a–410e) = Rev. R. G. Bury, LCL 1942 (1929) [Plato VII (IX)]</p>
                        <p>Socrates speaks only twice (one sentence each time) in this short Dialogue (the shortest in the entire corpus), in the Introductory section to <i>Cleitophon’s complaint about Socrates</i>.</p>
                        <p>1. “If it is necessary to live, it is better for such a person to spend his life as a slave rather than a free man, handing over<i> </i>the<i> <b>rudder</b> </i>of his<i> will, </i><b>as it were<i>,</i></b><i> <b>of a ship</b> </i>(<i>kathaper ploiou paradonti ta pêdalia tês dianoia</i>s)<i> </i>to someone else who knows the art of steering men (<i>kybernêtikê anthrôpôn</i>), which is what you often call (<i>eponomazeis pollakis</i>) politics (<i>politikên</i>), Socrates.” (408a–b) Cleitophon [one’s will = rudder of a ship]</p>

                        <p>Planned as a sequel to the <i>Republic</i> and <i>Timaeus</i>. At the beginning of his narrative (107c–e) Critias pleads for indulgence by citing the way we look at paintings (<i>tên tôn grapheôn eidôlopoiian</i>), where imitation and representation (<i>mimêsin kai apeikasian</i>) must be judged. We tolerate inexactness when it comes to portraying nature and the heavens but in likenesses of our own bodies we quickly perceive what is defective because of our greater familiarity with them. Thus his subject corresponds to the latter, whereas Timaeus portrayed more remote actions.</p>

                        <p>This Dialogue lacks almost all literary embellishments, including similes. Lamb calls it “a forgery” by “an inferior mind” (424), whose primary object is to supplement a passage at the end of <i>Laws</i> (12.966–7) about the training of the Nocturnal Council. However, we may note the alliteration near the beginning of the Dialogue (973c–d): “But one may rightly hope (<b><i>t</i></b><i>is pro<b>th</b>ymoi<b>t</b>’ an</i>) to attain after death (<b><i>t</i></b><i>eleu<b>t</b>êsan<b>t</b>i <b>t</b>ychein</i>) all the things for whose sake one may strive both in life to live as nobly as one can (<i>zôn <b>t</b>e hôs kallis<b>t</b>’ an zên ka<b>t</b>a dynamin</i>) and in death to find such a [noble] end (<i>kai <b>t</b>eleu<b>t</b>êsas <b>t</b>eleu<b>t</b>ês <b>t</b>oiau<b>t</b>ês <b>t</b>ychein</i>).

                        <p><b>Euthydemus</b> (St I.271a–307c) = W. R. M. Lamb, LCL 1977 (1924) [Plato II]</p>
                        <p><i>Socratic argumentation versus sophistic eristics.</i></p>
                        <p>E. H. Gifford says (10) that “the dramatic form is more prominent … than in any other of the Platonic dialogues” and distinguishes five dramatic episodes following a prologue and ending with an epilogue: scene 1 (starting at 272e), scene 2 (277d), scene 3 (283a), scene 4 (288b), and scene 5 (293d). R. S. W. Hawtry notes (63) that “these divisions are marked generally by narrative … and often by a striking simile.” As examples he cites <i>Euthydemus</i> 3 and <i>Euthydemus</i> 4 (below).</p>
                        <p>1. “When he said this, <b>like</b><i> </i>(<i>hôsper</i>)<i> a chorus</i> (<i>hoi agathai orchêstai</i>)<i> </i>given a signal by a <i>didaskalos </i>(<i>hypo didaskalou choros aposêmêmantas</i>)<i>,</i> <b><i>the followers</i></b> of <b><i>Dionysodorus and Euthydemus</i></b> shouted and laughed at the same time.” (276b) Socrates [the followers &gt; Dionysodorus and Euthydemus = a chorus &gt; the <i>didaskolos</i> (chorus teacher)] This simile follows the analogy of <i>citharist</i> and <i>grammatist</i> as <i>didaskaloi</i> mentioned a few lines earlier (276a). The clustering of six vivid similes in three Stephanus pages (276–278) emphasizes the playful nature of this Dialogue.</p>
                        <p>2. “<i>Euthydemos</i> … did not let the boy go but continued to ask questions and <b>like</b><i> </i>[<i>hôsper</i>]<i> <b>good dancers</b></i> (<i>hoi agathoi orchêstai</i>) turned the questions around doubling on the same point.” (276d) Socrates [Euthydemus = a good dancer]</p>
                        <p>3. “Euthydemus had hardly spoken when Dionysodorus caught the line of argument (<i>logos</i>) <b>like</b> a <b><i>ball</i></b> (<i>hôsper sphairan</i>) and aimed it at the lad (<i>estochazeto tou meirakiou</i>).” (277b) Socrates [<i>logos</i> = a ball]</p>
                        <p>Hawtry (67) again observes the use of this simile: “Once more a vivid image marks a structural point; the <i>logos</i> is the ball … appropriate enough in a gymnasium.”</p>
                        <p>4. “Euthydemus still continued to rush at the lad <i>having thrown him</i> [in debate] for the third time <b>as</b><i> </i>[<i>hôsper</i>]<i> <b>in wrestling</b>.”</i> (277c) Socrates [Euthydemus in debate = winning wrestler] See Hawtrey’s commentary (especially 63 and 67) on Plato’s use of the similes to mark the shifts in narrative. Lee (1964) also says in passing (without much demonstration) that in the <i>Iliad</i> “similes are used to open as well as to close scenes” (4n19).</p>
                        <p>5. “<i>They</i> are acting just <b>like</b> (<i>poieîton taûton hoper</i>) <b><i>the celebrants</i></b> (<i>hoi en têi teletêi</i>).” (277d) Socrates [Euthydemos and Dionysodorus = the celebrants] There follows a long sentence explaining the comparison.</p>
                        <p>In reference to this passage Hawtrey says (70): “Once more a structural point in the dialogue is marked by vigorous images; compare 276b.6ff., d5ff., 277b3ff.” In his introduction (34) Hawtrey discusses the imagery of this Dialogue briefly and alludes to some of the similes below.</p>
                        <p>6. “I call it a sport (<i>paidian</i>) … because of the differences in the sense of the words, by tripping them up and overturning them; <b>just as</b><i> </i>[<i>hôsper</i>] those who slyly pull stools away from persons who are about to sit down … laugh when they see someone sprawling on his back (<i>hyption anatetrammenon</i>).” (278b) Socrates [those playing word games = people who pull stools away from someone about to sit down]</p>
                        <p>7. “I am ready to hand myself over <i>to Dionysodorus</i> here <b>as if</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <i>he</i> were the [famous] <b><i>Medea of Colchis</i></b>.” (285c) Socrates [Dionysodorus = Medea]</p>
                        <p>8. “I too, Socrates, am ready to offer myself to be skinned by the visitors … if <i>my hide</i> is not to end up being made into a wine-skin, <b>like</b> [<i>hôsper</i>] Marsyas’, but into the shape of virtue.” (285c–d) Ctesippus [my hide ≠ Marsyas’ hide, but = virtue (≠ a wine-skin)] A simile parallel with the previous one.</p>
                        <p>9. “I see certain <i>speech-writers</i> (<i>logopoious</i>) who do not know how to use the special arguments (<i>tois idiois logois</i>) which they themselves have made, <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>lyre-makers</i></b> [who cannot play] the lyres (<i>hoi lyropoioi taîs lyrais</i>) which they made.” (289d) Cleinias [speech-writers = lyre-makers]</p>
                        <p>At 290a Socrates makes an analogy between the sorcerer’s art (<i>he tôn epôdôn technê</i>)—charming (<i>kêlêsis</i>) of snakes and scorpions etc.—and the speech-writer’s art—the charming and soothing (<i>paramythia</i>) of juries, assemblies and crowds.<i></i></p>
                        <p>10–11. “<i>We</i> were as funny <b>as</b> [<i>hôsper</i>]<i> <b>children chasing larks</b></i> (<i>korydous</i>): we always thought we would catch one of the <i>epistemes</i> (types of knowledge) but they always escaped… Then <b>like</b> [<i>hôsper</i>] <b><i>people who have fallen into a labyrinth</i></b>, thinking that we were at the end, turning back around we realized that we were, as it were [<i>hôsper</i>], <i>at the beginning of the investigation</i>.” (291b–c) Socrates [we/Socrates in our investigation = children chasing larks = people fallen into a labyrinth and back where they started]</p>
                        <p>Socrates answers Crito’s question whether Socrates found the object of his search for the art that knows how to <b>use</b> what it has <b>acquired</b>.</p>
                        <p>12. “Finding I had fallen into this perplexity, I began to exclaim at the top of my voice, beseeching <i>the two strangers</i> (<i>toîs xenoin</i>), <b>as though</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) I were calling upon the <b><i>Heavenly Twins</i></b> (<i>Dioskourôn epikaloumenos</i>), to save us (<i>sôsai hêmâs</i>), the lad and myself, from the mighty wave of argument (<i>ek tês trikymias toû logou</i>). (293a) Socrates (293a) [the two strangers = the Dioskouroi]</p>
                        <p>13. <i>They</i> most valiantly answered his (Ctesippus’) questions … <b>like</b> [<i>hôsper</i>] <b><i>boars</i></b> (<i>kaproi</i>) when driven up to face the spears. (294d) Socrates [Euthydemos and Dionysodorus &gt; questions = boars &gt; spears]</p>
                        <p>14. “<i>I</i> am <b>much weaker </b>(<i>phauloteros</i>)<b> than</b> <b><i>Heracles</i></b> (<i>tou Hêrakleous</i>) who was no match for the Hydra, that she-professor (<i>sophistria</i>) who was so clever that she sent forth many heads of debate (<i>tou logou</i>) for each one that was cut off.” (297c) Socrates [I/Socrates &gt; both of you = Heracles &gt; heads of the Hydra] Socrates uses the simile of cutting off the Hydra’s head at <i>Republic</i> 426e for enacting and amending certain laws trying to find a way to put an end to frauds in business.</p>
                        <p>15. “But, <i>Dionysiodorus, you</i> seem to be finishing off your dialogue very well, <b>like</b> [<i>hôsper</i>] <b><i>craftsmen</i></b> (<i>dêmiourgoi</i>) who put the final touches on each of their products.” (301c) Socrates [Euthydemos and Dionysodorus &gt; dialogue = craftsmen &gt; products]</p>
                        <p>16. “Tell me, Socrates,” he [Dionysiodorus] said, “do you have an ancestral Zeus?” <i>I,</i> suspecting that the <i>discussion</i> would arrive at the place where it did end, by some difficult twist tried to escape and began to turn now <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>)<i> <b>a </b></i>[<b><i>fish or animal</i></b>]<b><i> caught in a net</i></b> (<i>diktyôi</i>), and said, “No, I do not, O Dionysodorus.” (302b) Socrates [I/Socrates &gt; the discussion = a fish or animal &gt; (caught in) a net] Socrates adds that he was “knocked out, as it were, by the argument (<i>hôsper plêgeis hypo tou logou</i>) and lay speechless (<i>eneimên aphônos</i>).”</p>

                        <p>Note Socrates’ detailed description of Meletus in the previous sentence (2b): “His name is Meletus, I believe.

In the next few pages as Callicles begins to become exasperated at the course of the argument (“won’t this man stop drivelling nonsense [<i>phlyarôn</i>]?”), Socrates addresses him ironically as “most sapient” (ô <i>sophôtate</i>), “my wonderful friend” (<i>ô daimonie</i>), and “admirable sir” (<i>ô thaumasie</i>)—to which Callicles replies (489e), “You are being sarcastic/ironic (<i>eirôneuêi</i>), Socrates.” Socrates denies this: “No, by Zethus, whom you used just now for aiming a good deal of sarcasm at me (<i>polla nundê eirôneuou pros me</i>).”</p>

                        <p>At 493d Socrates begins to construct another illustration (<i>allên eikona</i>)<i> </i>“from the same school as the first” (<i>ek ton autou gymnasiou têi nûn</i>) about two men (<i>sôphrôn</i> vs <i>akolastos</i>) with jars, one of whom has to keep filling his because of leaks.</p>

                        <p>15. “O Callicles, what a rascal you are, treating <i>me</i> <b>like</b> <b><i>a child</i></b> (<i>chrêi moi hôsper paidi</i>). (499c) Socrates [me = a child] This is in reply to Callicles’ taunt that Socrates takes puerile delight in clinging “to any concession one may make you even in jest <b>like</b> <b><i>children</i></b> (<i>hôsper ta meirakia</i>).”</p>
                        <p>16. “<i>I</i> am (<i>eimi</i>) at the mercy of anyone who wishes (<i>epi tôi boulomenôi</i>), <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>an outlaw</i></b>(<b><i>s</i></b>) (<i>hoi atimoi</i>), to the whim of anyone who chooses to give me—the dashing phrase is yours (<i>to neanikon dê toûto toû soû logoû</i>)—a box on the ear (<i>an te typtein epi korrês</i>).” (508c) Socrates [I/Socrates = an outlaw]</p>

                        <p>Notice Socrates’ punning phrase earlier in the Dialogue (225e): <i>kai hôra kai chôra</i> (‘season and soil’, a word jingle), followed by Socrates’ apologetic clause, “if we too may throw in one of those artful phrases (<i>tôn soph</i>ô<i>n</i> <i>rheumatôn</i>)<i> </i>which adroit pleaders<i> </i>(<i>hoi dexioi</i>)<i> </i>use to trick out (<i>kalliepoûntai</i>)<i> </i>their speeches in the law courts<i>.” </i>(Lamb’s translation, p.<i> </i>281); and the maxims of Hipparchus that Socrates quotes at 229 a–b: “walk with just intent” (<i>steîche dikaia phronôn</i>) and “deceive not a friend” (<i>mê philon exapata</i>) after the Delphic sayings “Know thyself” (<i>gnothi sauton</i>) and “Nothing in excess” (<i>mêden agan</i>). Also interesting are the numerous ‘negative’ analogies that Socrates offers early in the Dialogue: farmers (225b), horsemen (226a), navigator (226d), general (226c), flute-player, harper, horseman, and other craftsmen (<i>dêmiourgôn</i>).</p>
                        <p>At 232b Hipparchus says that Socrates’ argument (<i>logos</i>) has ‘compelled’ (<i>ênangkake</i>) him rather than ‘persuaded’ (<i>pepeiken</i>) him that all gains, both small and great, are good. At any rate, in the concluding sentence (232c) Socrates states that it is not right to reproach anyone with being a lover of gain (<i>contra</i> Hipparchus who had said at the beginning of the Dialogue that lovers of gain were not fools (<i>anoêtous</i>) but ‘rascals’ (<i>panourgous</i>) and ‘wicked’ (<i>ponêtous</i>).</p>

                        <p>2. “I realize that in all likelihood the <i>Lacedaimonians</i> welcome you [Hippias] because of your wide knowledge, and they use <b><i>you</i></b> <b>as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <i>children</i> treat <b><i>old women</i></b> (<i>tais presbutisin</i>) to tell pleasant stories.” (285e–286a) Socrates [Lacedaimonians &gt; you (Hippias) = children &gt; old women who tell stories]</p>
                        <p>3. “[‘What is beauty’ is my question.] I cannot shout it out any more than if<i> you </i>were sitting beside (<i>parekathêso</i>)<i> me </i>[<b>like</b>]<i> </i>a <b><i>rock</i></b><i> </i>(<i>lithos</i>)<i>,</i> <b><i>or</i></b> (<i>kai</i>) <b><i>even a millstone</i></b> (<i>mylias</i>), with neither ears nor a brain.” (292d) Socrates (imagining what his ‘friend’ would say to him) [you/Socrates = a rock or a millstone]</p>
                        <p>Socrates refers to this person at 288d: “someone not elegant (<i>komphos</i>) but vulgar (<i>syrphetos</i>), concerned with nothing more than the truth” and 298d: “the man I mean, or someone else.”</p>

                        <p>There are several simple comparisons: e.g. “Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> is a <b>finer</b> poem <b>than</b> his <i>Odyssey</i>” (Socrates quoting Apemantus at 363b); “I have never met anyone <b>better than</b> myself (<i>kreittoni emautou</i>) in anything” (Hippias at 364a); “Homer made Achilles <b>better than</b> Odysseus” (364c ff); “I have no doubt that you are <b>wiser than</b> I, Hippias” (369d); “Socrates always makes confusion in arguments and <b>is</b> <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) a trouble-maker (<i>kakourgounti, </i>373b)”; plus many analogies in argument.</p>

                        <p>1. “This is not <i>an art</i> (<i>toûto technê ouk on</i>) in you by which you speak well about Homer (<i>peri Homêrou oû legein</i>), as I was just saying, but a <b><i>divine power</i></b> which moves you (<i>theia dynamis hê se kineî</i>), <b>like</b> [<b><i>that</i>]<i> in the stone</i></b> (<i>hôsper en têi lithô</i>) which Euripides called a Magnet but most people call a Heraclean [stone].” (533d) Socrates [(your ability to speak about Homer =) a divine power (≠ an art) = a magnet or Heraclean stone]</p>
                        <p>Socrates explains this by no means self-evident comparison (533d–e) as follows: just as a stone “attracts iron rings and imparts to them a power whereby they in turn are able to … attract other rings … in the same way the Muse inspires men … and then by means of these inspired persons the inspiration spreads to others … For all good epic poets utter all those fine poems not from art, but as inspired and possessed …”</p>
                        <p>2. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>)<i> <b>the Corybantes</b></i> [<b><i>worshippers</i></b>] do not dance when sober (<i>emphrones ontes</i>), so the <i>lyric poets</i> are not sober when they compose these beautiful poems, but whenever they enter into their harmony and rhythm, they are reveling and possessed (<i>katechomenoi</i>) <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>the bacchants</i></b> are possessed when they draw honey and milk from the rivers.” (534a) Socrates [lyric poets = Corybantian worshippers and bacchants]</p>
                        <p>3. “ For the <i>poet</i>s no doubt tell us that they <i>bring us</i> <i>songs</i> from honey-flowing fountains culling them from the glens and gardens of the Muses <b>like</b> <b><i>bees</i></b> (<i>hôsper hai melittai</i>) [<b><i>bring</i></b> <b><i>honey</i></b>] and flying in the same way.” (534a–b) Socrates [poets bring songs = bees (bring honey)]</p>
                        <p>4. “For a <i>poet</i> (<i>poêtês</i>) <b>is</b> (<i>esti</i>) a <b><i>light</i></b> (<i>koûphon</i>) and <b><i>winged</i></b> (<i>ptênon</i>) and <b><i>sacred</i></b> (<i>hieron</i>) <b><i>thing</i></b> (<i>chrêma</i>) … inspired (<i>entheos</i>) and out of his senses (<i>ekphrôn</i>).” (534b) Socrates [poet = winged and sacred thing etc.)</p>

                        <p>Socrates uses four similes (1–4) in one page (533d–534b) to reinforce his argument that “poets are merely interpreters of gods” (534e: <i>poêtai ouden all’ ê hermênês eisi tôn theôn</i>).

                        <p>2. “And so in fact this is not a thing which, as the proverb says (<i>kata tên paroimian</i>), “<i>any pig</i> (<i>pâsa hys</i>) would know”; and thus <i>a pig</i> cannot be courageous.” (Socrates) “I think not.” (Nicias) “Indeed it is obvious, Nicias, that you at least do <b>not</b> believe that <b><i>even the Crommyonian sow</i></b> (or “a pig <b>as big as</b> the Crommyonian sow”) <b>could have been</b> courageous.” (196 d–e) Socrates [a pig ≠ the Crommyonian sow]</p>
                        <p>One may see a simile hidden in this formulaic language since both <i>tenor</i> (pig) and <b><i>vehicle</i></b> (Crommyonian sow) are stated. This kind of expression uses exaggeration to make its point and a mythical personage is introduced to strengthen the comparison. Thus the words ‘not even’ (<i>oude</i> in Greek) introduce the simile, with the <b>prothesis</b> ‘as big as’ only implied. Jowett in fact renders it as a simile: “not even such a big pig as the Crommyonian sow.” (B.

                        <p>1. “I consider that only this <i>law</i> (<i>nomos</i>) is correctly enacted which aims (<i>stochazêtai</i>) <b>like</b> <b><i>an archer</i></b> (<i>dikên toxotou</i>) at that which is associated with something beautiful.” (705e) Athenian Visitor [law = archer]; Cf. the same simile in Book Eleven below (Bk 11.1).</p>
                        <p>2. “<i>Settlements</i> would not be so easy for cities as those when, <b>like</b> (<i>ton tropon</i>) <b><i>a swarm</i></b> (<i>esmôn</i>: of bees), a single clan goes out from a single city and settles down.” (708b) Athenian Visitor [a single clan of citizens = a swarm (of bees)]</p>
                        <p>3. “On the other hand, the <i>clan</i> (<i>genos</i>) formed by the fusion of various elements would perhaps be more ready to submit to new laws, but to cause it to share in one spirit and pant (as they say) in unison <b>like</b> <b><i>a team of horses</i></b> (<i>kathaper hippôn zeûgos</i>) would be a lengthy and difficult task.” (708d) Athenian Visitor [clan = a team of horses]</p>
                        <p>4. “There is an ancient saying … that whenever a <i>poet</i> is seated on the Muse’s tripod, he is not in his senses (<i>emphrôn</i>) but is <b>like</b> some <b><i>fountain</i></b> (<i>hoion krênê tis</i>) which allows the upward flowing water to flow freely.” (719c) Athenian Visitor [poet on the Muse’s tripod = a fountain]</p>
                        <p>5. “Just as (<i>kathaper</i>) one doctor is accustomed to treat us [patients] in one way, another in another way, so <i>we beg the lawmaker</i>, <b>as</b> (<i>kathaper</i>) <b><i>children beg a doctor</i></b> to give them the mildest treatment.” (720a) Athenian Visitor [we &gt; lawmakers = children &gt; a doctor]</p>

                        <p>Book Five is a monologue by the Athenian Visitor, with hypothetical questions introduced at 743a and Clinias’ final sentence. There is a long prologue on the soul as man’s most divine possession.</p>
                        <p>1. “<i>One</i> should show pity (to the wrongdoer) and abate one’s passion … and not keep on raging [<b>like]</b> <b><i>a scolding wife</i></b> (<i>mê akracholoûnta gynaikeîôs pikrainomenon diateleîn</i>). (731d) Athenian Visitor [one ≠ scolding wife(ly)] A denominative (adverbial) simile.</p>
                        <p>2. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) there must be an <b><i>opposite inflow whenever there is an outflow</i></b> (<i>aporrheontos</i>), [so] when <i>wisdom</i> (<i>phronêseôs</i>) <i>flies away,</i> <i>recollection</i> (<i>anamnêsis</i>) <i>is the inflow</i> (<i>epirrhoê</i>).” (732b) Athenian Visitor [recollection &gt; wisdom = inflow &gt; outflow]</p>
                        <p>3. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>kathaper</i>) in any woven article (<i>plegma</i>) it is not possible to make both <b><i>warp and woof</i></b> (<i>ephyphen kai ton stêmona</i>)<i> </i>from the same material …, whence (<i>hothen</i>) we must mark out in some such way <i>those who are to hold high office</i> (<i>arxontas</i>) and <i>those who are to hold low offices</i> (<i>tous smikras</i>).” (734e–735a) Athenian Visitor [future office holders = warp and woof]</p>
                        <p>4. “The best (<i>aristos</i>) <i>purge</i> (<i>katharmos</i>) [i.e. exile or death] is painful (<i>algeinos</i>), <b>like</b> (<i>kathaper</i>) all drastic <b><i>medicines</i></b> (<i>hosa tôn pharmakôn</i>).” (735d) Athenian Visitor [purge = all drastic medicines]</p>
                        <p>5. “A milder (<i>praoteros</i>) form of purge [i.e. emigration (<i>apoikia</i>)] [is used] when owing to scarcity of food … people attack the property of the wealthy … <i>such people</i> the lawgiver regards <b>as</b> a<b><i> disease </i></b>(<i>hôs nosêmati</i>) inherent in the city.” (735e–736a) Athenian Visitor [such people = an inherent disease]</p>
                        <p>The first five similes surround “the prelude of our laws” (734e, <i>to prooimion tôn nomôn</i>), with a pun on the double sense of <i>nomos</i> (law and musical nome or tune): “after the prelude must necessarily follow the tune (<i>anangkaîon pou vomon hepesthai</i>).” Then five more similes (6–10) help to clarify the establishment of the model constitution (<i>paradeigma ge politeias</i>, 739e) and the apportioning of land.</p>
                        <p>6. “<b>Just as </b>when (<i>hoîon</i>) there is a confluence of floods from many sources—some from springs, some from torrents—into a single pool, we take diligent precaution to insure the purity of the water by <b><i>drawing it off in some cases, and in others by making channels to divert its course</i></b>—for the present (<i>pros to paron</i>) we do not need to contrive either a form of <i>emigration or any other purgative selection</i> drawing off water or making channels.” (736a–b) Athenian Visitor [emigration or any purge = drawing off water or making channels]</p>
                        <p>7. “[<i>The rule of moderation</i> (<i>tês metriotêtos</i>)] is the main foundation for the security of the state (<i>sôtêrias archê megistê poleôs</i>) and <i>on this</i> <b>as</b> <b><i>on a firm keel</i></b> (<i>hoîon krêpidos monimou</i>) it is possible to build a civic organization (<i>kosmon politikon</i>).” (736e) Athenian Visitor [rule of moderation = a firm keel]</p>
                        <p>8. “Let <i>this</i> [<i>renouncing avarice</i> by the aid of justice (<i>mê philochrêmateîn meta dikês</i>)] stand fixed for us now <b>as</b> a kind of<b><i> pillar of the state</i></b> (<i>hoîon herma poleôs</i>)” (737a) Athenian Visitor [renouncing avarice = a pillar of the state]</p>
                        <p>9. “The <i>next move</i> (<i>hê dê to meta toûto phora</i>, i.e. the choice of politics, at 739b) might at first cause surprise (<i>thaumasai</i>), <b>like</b> (<i>kathaper</i>) the <b><i>move of a draughts-player </i></b>who quits his ‘sacred line’ (<i>pettôn aph’ hieroû</i>).” (739a) Athenian Visitor [next move (political) = move of a draughts-player]</p>
                        <p>10. “Let the <i>man who receives his portion</i> [(<i>ho lachôn</i>) 1/5040<sup>th</sup>] <i>tend </i>[<i>therapeuein deî</i>] <i>the land</i>, which is his fatherland, <b>more diligently than</b> (<i>meizonôs ê</i>) <b><i>a mother tends her children</i></b> (<i>mêtera paîdas</i>)” (740a) Athenian Visitor [the owner &gt; the land/fatherland = a mother &gt; her children]</p>
                        <p>11. “The lawgiver (<i>nomothetês</i>) will <i>set the dwellings </i>in the center and around the circumference—almost <b>as if</b> he were <b><i>telling dreams</i></b> (<i>pantêi schedon <b>hoîon</b> eneipata legôn</i>) <b><i>or moulding</i></b> (<i>ê plattôn</i>), so to say (<i>kathaper</i>), <b><i>a city and citizens out of wax</i></b> (<i>ek kêrou tina polin dai politas</i>).” (746a–b) Athenian Visitor [setting dwellings = telling dreams or moulding city and citizens from wax] I.e. such citizens give no more resistance to the planner than wax gives to an artisan.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><b>Laws VI</b> (751–785) R. G. Bury, LCL 1967 (1926) [Plato X]</p>
                        <p><i>Officials and legislation.</i></p>
                        <p>Two sections contain analogies as interesting alternatives to similes (765e and 769c):</p>
                        <p>765e consists of an observation about plants that is intended to serve as a parallel for mankind: the importance of the first sprout to the development of the mature plant; thus the importance of early education (“for the first shoot of every plant [shows how the mature plant will develop]”).</p>
                        <p>769c contains another such parallel example: “We may use this … to illustrate the following point: suppose that a man should propose (<i>to toionde, hôs ei pote tis epinoêseie</i>) to paint a very beautiful creature (<i>zôon</i>) … that would never grow worse but always better; since the painter is mortal, unless he leaves a successor to repair and improve the painting, his toil will be short-lived… The purpose of the lawgiver is similar.” Because of the absence of <i>prothesis, tenor</i> and <i>vehicle</i>, we should call these analogies.</p>
                        <p>1. “It is not easy to realize that a <i>city-state</i> (<i>polis</i>) should be mixed <b>like</b> a <b><i>bowl of wine</i></b> (<i>eînai deî dikên kratêros kekramenên</i>), where when the wine is first poured in, it foams madly, but as soon as it is chastened by the sober deity of water, it forms a fair alliance and produces a potion that is good and moderate. That this is precisely what happens in the blending of children is something which hardly anyone is able to perceive.” (773d) Athenian Visitor [city-state = a bowl of mixed wine]</p>
                        <p>2. “Some people place no trust at all in the class of servants, but treat <i>them</i> <b>like</b> <b><i>animals</i></b> (<i>kata thêriôn physin</i>) with goads and whips …” (777a) Athenian Visitor [them (slaves) = animals]</p>
                        <p>3. “They (the citizens) will believe that their safety is ensured if <i>they</i> are fenced in by walls and go to sleep <b>like</b> <b><i>men born to shirk toil</i></b> (<i>hôs epi to mê poneîn gegonotas</i>].” (779a) Athenian Visitor [they = men born to shirk toil]</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><b>Laws VII</b> (788–824) R. G. Bury, LCL 1967 (1926) [Plato XI]</p>
                        <p><i>Nurture and education in the ideal city-state.</i></p>
                        <p>The Athenian Visitor continues to speak with Clinias (Kleinias) and Megillus.</p>
                        <p>1. “Shall we lay down a law that … <i>the developing child</i> (<i>to genomen</i>) shall be molded <b>like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>wax</i></b> (<i>kêrinon</i>)?” (789e) Athenian Visitor [developing child = wax]</p>
                        <p>Notice the similes incorporated into the adjectives in the following phrase: “the <i>womanish</i> and <i>servile</i> habits of nurses (<i>gynaikeîa te kai douleia êthê trophôn</i>).” (790a) Athenian Visitor [adjectival similes: <i>like a woman</i> and <i>like a slave</i>]</p>
                        <p>2. “Thus they (mothers) <i>literally</i> (<i>atechnôs hoîon</i>)<i> </i>cast a spell upon (<i>katauloûsi tôn paidiôn</i>) the <i>children</i> <b>like</b> (<i>kathaperei</i>) the <b><i>victims of Bacchic frenzy</i></b> (<i>tôn ekphronôn Bakcheiôn</i>) by employing the combined movements of dance and song.” (790e) Athenian Visitor [children = victims of Bacchic frenzy] The metaphor ‘cast a spell’ (or rather, “play the aula or flute upon”) is preceded by a phrase often associated with similes (<i>atechnôs hoîon</i>, ‘truly as it were’).</p>
                        <p>3–4. “<i>These</i> [<i>regulations</i> (<i>agrapha nomima,</i> ‘unwritten laws’ (793a)] are just the same as ‘ancestral customs’ (<i>patrious nomous</i>); though not laws (<i>nomoi</i>), they act as (<i>eisi</i>) <b><i>bonds</i></b> (<i>desmoi</i>) in every constitution (<i>politeias</i>), forming a link between all its laws both written and unwritten, <b>exactly like</b> (<i>atechnôs hoîon</i>) <b><i>ancestral customs</i></b> of great antiquity (<i>archaîa nomima</i>).” (793b) Athenian Visitor [unwritten laws = bonds (= ancestral customs)] Predicate simile followed by a conventional simile.</p>
                        <p>5. “If <i>they </i>(<i>the bonds</i>) perversely go aside from the right way, <b>like</b> <b><i>builders’ props</i></b> (<i>hoîon tektonôn en oikodomêmasin ereismata</i>) that collapse under the middle of the house, they bring everything else tumbling down along with them, one thing buried under another, first the props themselves and then the fair superstructure, once the ancient supports have fallen down.” (793c) Athenian Visitor [the bonds = builders’ props]</p>
                        <p>6. “Due to the folly of nurses and mothers <i>we</i> <b>have become</b> <b>like</b> <b><i>lame people</i></b> (<i>hoîon chôloi</i>), so to say, in our hands.” (794e) Athenian Visitor [we = lame people]</p>
                        <p>I.e. by nature we should be able to use both hands equally well but we become deficient from poor training.</p>
                        <p>7. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>kathaper</i>) [<b><i>a man</i></b>]<b><i> who has come to a crossroad</i>s</b> and is not quite sure of his way … will question himself … or others … and refuses to proceed until he has made sure by investigation of the right direction, <i>we</i> must now do likewise (<i>hêmîn hôsautôs</i>)<i> about</i> the laws (<i>peri nomôn</i>).” (799c–d) Athenian Visitor [we = a man who has come to a crossroads]</p>
                        <p>8–9. “<b>Just as</b> <b><i>a shipwright</i></b> (<i>hoîon dê tis naupêgos</i>) at the commencement of a building outlines the shape of his vessel by laying down her keel, <b>so</b> <i>I</i> appear to be doing <i>the same thing</i> (<i>tauton dê moi kagô</i>)—trying to frame the shapes of lives according to the modes of their souls, and thus literally (<i>ontôs</i>) laying down their keels … to navigate our [<i>barque of</i>]<i> life</i> through this <b><i>voyage of existence</i></b> (<i>ton bion arista dia toû ploû toutou tês zôês</i>)” (803a) Athenian Visitor [I = a shipwright; life = a voyage] Here the simile introduces a metaphor with <i>two genitive similes</i> (only the latter is in the Greek).</p>
                        <p>10. “At daylight children should return to their teachers, for [<b>just as</b>] no (<i>oute</i>) <b><i>sheep</i></b> (<i>probata</i>) or other grazing beast ought to exist without a herdsman, [so] nor can (<i>oude</i>) <i>children</i> live without some tutors nor (<i>oude</i>) slaves without masters. Of all wild creatures (<i>thêriôn</i>) the child is the most difficult to manage (<i>dysmetacheiristotaton</i>).” (808d) Athenian Visitor [children &gt; tutors = sheep &gt; herdsman] Thus with the addition of prothetic words (<i>hôsper</i> and <i>houtôs</i>), the analogy becomes a simile.</p>
                        <p>11. “The child must be strapped up (<i>deî desmeuein</i>), as it were, with many bridles (<i>hoîon chalinoîs tisi</i>), treating him as a freeborn child; … on the other hand, <i>he</i> must be treated <b>as</b> <b><i>a slave</i></b> (<i>hôs d’aû doûlon</i>).” (808e) Athenian Visitor [child = a slave] A second simile is implied here by the phrase ‘strapped up, as it were, with many bridles’, suggesting a comparison between a child and a horse.</p>
                        <p>12. “It appeared to me that <i>they</i> (<i>our discourses</i>, <i>logoi</i>) were framed exactly [<b>like]</b> a <b><i>poem</i></b> (<i>pantapasi poiêsei tini prosomoiôs eirêsthai</i>).” (811c) Athenian Visitor [our discourse = a poem] I.e. our discourses were most moderate (<i>metriôtatoi</i>) and suitable (<i>prosêkontes</i>) for young people to hear.</p>
                        <p>13<i>. “</i>If an invading army should force a battle around the city, it would be a sore disgrace to the State if its<i> women</i> (<i>tas gynaîkas</i>) were … not willing to do <b>as</b> <b><i>mother-birds</i></b> (<i>hôsper ornithas</i>), which fight the strongest beasts in defense of their broods (<i>peri teknôn</i>).” (814b) Athenian Visitor [women = mother-birds]</p>
                        <p>14. “Shall we not lay [<i>these subjects</i>] down as necessary subjects of instruction (<i>tôn deontôn mathêmatôn</i>)? And yet we ought to lay them down provisionally—<b>like <i>pledges</i></b> capable of redemption (<i>kathaper enechura lysima</i>)—apart from the rest of our constitution.” (820e) Athenian Visitor [these subjects = pledges] ‘These subjects’ are the problems concerning the essential nature of the commensurable and the incommensurable.</p>

                        <p>Athenian Visitor speaking to Clinias (Kleinias) and Megillus.</p>
                        <p>1. “He that is in love with the body and hungering after <i>its bloom</i> (<i>tes hôras</i>), <b>as </b>it were that of a <b><i>ripening peach</i></b> (<i>kathaper opôras</i>), urges himself to take his fill of it …” (837c) Athenian Visitor [the body’s bloom = a ripening peach]</p>
                        <p>Cf. <i>Symposium</i> 183d: “As soon as the bloom of the body he so loved begins to fade (<i>hama gar tôi toû sômatos anthei lêgonti</i>), he ‘flutters off and is gone’.” Here the ‘he’ refers to the wicked popular lover who craves the body rather than the soul; the quotation refers to Agamemnon’s remark about his dream in Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> 2.71.</p>
                        <p>2. “I say that our regulations must proclaim … that <i>our citizens</i> must not be <b>worse than</b> <b><i>birds</i></b> (<i>cheirous … ornithôn</i>) and <b><i>many animals</i></b> (<i>thêriôn</i>) … which live chaste and celibate lives.” (840d) Athenian Visitor [our citizens ≠ birds and many animals] And again, “And surely <i>our citizens</i> should at least be <b>better than</b> <b><i>these animals</i></b> (<i>thêriôn ameinous</i>). (840e) [our citizens = these animals]</p>

                        <p>1. “[We may dread] lest <i>any of our citizens</i> (<i>tis … tôn politôn</i>) should prove <b><i>horny-hearted</i></b> (<i>hoîon kerasbolos</i> = ‘hard-shelled’ seed struck by a beast’s horns and therefore unfit for cooking [201n1]) … and <b>just as</b> those ‘<b><i>horn-struck’ beans</i></b> (<i>kathaper ekeîna ta spermata</i>) cannot be softened by fire … so <i>these </i>(<i>hoûtoi</i>) should be uninfluenced by laws.” (853c–d) Athenian Visitor [our citizens NOT influenced by law = horn-struck beans NOT influenced by fire] Note the adjectival simile embedded in <b><i>horny-hearted</i></b> (<i>hoîon kerasbolos</i>) = a <i>heart</i> <b>like</b> <b><i>horn</i></b>.</p>
                        <p>2. “It was not a bad comparison (<i>apêikasamen</i>) we made [starting at 720a ff.] when we <b>compared</b> (<i>apêikazomen</i>) all <i>those who now make laws for themselves</i> (<i>nomothetoumenous</i>) to <b><i>slaves as it were being treated by slaves</i></b> (<i>doulois hôs iatreuomenois hypo doulôn</i>)” (857c) Athenian Visitor [people who make laws for themselves = slaves who doctor themselves]</p>

                        <p>1. “If it were necessary (<i>ei kathaper</i>) for the <i>three of us,</i> as it were, to cross <b><i>a river</i></b> flowing swiftly and I, being youngest and most experienced in currents, were to suggest that I make the attempt first to see if the river be fordable … (e) so too now <i>the argument</i> about to begin (<i>ho mellôn logos</i>) is too violent and perhaps even impassable for you.” (892d–e) Athenian Visitor [argument = a fast-flowing river] The difficult argument (<i>logos</i>) is the one proving that the soul is prior to the body (<i>proteron on psychên sômatos</i>; see 893a).</p>

                        <p>It is perhaps surprising <i>not to find</i> more <i>similes</i> in this rhetorical work with its exaggerated eulogy of autochthony (237b) and pious mother earth (237c) who produces grain and olive as nourishments (238a–c)—but it must be noted that the other extant funeral speeches (<i>epitaphioi</i>) do not have numerous similes either. (See Appendix V 5.) There is a rather dry review of the Athenian mythical and historical tradition (239a–b), Marathon and Salamis (240e–241), Plateia and later (242). There are several comparisons that could have been similes: (e.g. 235c) “When I hear these patriotic orators I imagine that I am living on the Isles of the Blessed;” or trite similes: “<i>our polis</i> is the <b><i>handmaiden</i></b> of the weak” (244d); or 247b: “In their parents’ honors the children possess a noble and splendid treasure (<i>kalos thêsauros</i>).” By listing some events (245e) that occurred after the speaker’s death (such as the Peace of Antalcidas in 387/6 BC) perhaps Plato is intentionally parodying what Bury called (Introduction, 330) the most glaring defect of contemporary oratory, “its indifference to truth.” On the one hand, he avoids obvious rhetorical forms like similes and metaphors; on the other hand, he adds to that most hackneyed of comparisons (the city as “our mother,” 237e) by stating that the city is not only our mother, but also father (to the sons), son and heir (to the fallen), and guardian (to their parents) (See 249a–c). He does this without using the formulae of similes but by prosaic phrases such as “[the city] standing in the role of father” (<i>en patros schêmati katastâsa</i>, 249a) and “in the position of heir and son etc.” (<i>en klêronomou kai hyeos moirai, en patros … en epitropou</i>, 249b–c) in contrast to the funeral oration attributed to Pericles, who had famously compared the lost soldiers to the spring taken from the year. (See “Aristotle” above, Introduction, Section A 1.)</p>
                        <p>This is the only Dialogue that does not have a philosophical aspect, and it is not apparent what Plato’s purpose was in composing it. <a href="#n4" name="a4">[4]</a> The frame portion (e.g. 235c6) makes clear Socrates’ fondness for mocking the orators (Menexenos: “You are always mocking [<i>prospaizeis</i>] the rhetoricians, Socrates”), so the various examples of alliteration, often a sign of light-heartedness or humor in Plato, would add to this impression.

                        <p>1. “I seem to be very lucky, Meno, if in seeking <i>one virtue</i> I have discovered (<i>anêurêka</i>) a swarm (<i>smênos</i>) of virtues (<i>aretôn</i>) lying beside you. (72a) … Now to follow this figure (<i>eikona</i>) of a swarm, suppose I should ask you what is the real nature of a <b><i>bee</i></b> (<i>melittês</i>)?” (72b–c) Socrates [virtue = a bee]</p>
                        <p>The comparison of bees and virtues continues through 72b–c. The word <i>eikona</i> here means something general like <i>figure, image, comparison</i>, or specifically a <i>simile </i>(or<i> metaphor</i>). See below (<i>Republic</i> 5.450a) for ‘swarm of arguments’ and Introduction C.6.2.</p>
                        <p>2. “[Socrates, I have heard that] you yourself are confused (<i>aporeis</i>) and you make others confused (<i>aporein</i>). And now, it seems to me, you are bewitching (<i>goêteueis</i>) and charming (<i>kai pharmatteis</i>) me and actually casting spells (<i>kai atechnôs katepaideis</i>) so that I am full of confusion (<i>meston aporias</i>). If I may jest (<i>skôpsai</i>),] <i>you</i> seem to me to be in appearance (<i>eidos</i>) and other respects <b>most like</b> (<i>homoiotatos</i>) a <b><i>flat torpedo sea-</i>fish </b>[sting<i> </i>ray] (<i>tautêi têi plateiai napkêi têi thalattiai</i>)… For really I am numb (<i>narkô</i>) in my soul and tongue and I cannot answer you.” (Meno 80a–b) Meno [you/Socrates = a torpedo fish]</p>
                        <p>Meno does not actually indicate how Socrates’ <i>appearance</i> (<i>eidos</i>) is like that of a torpedo sea-fish (perhaps an allusion to his snub-nosed face?); he comments only on the effect of being ‘stung’ by Socrates. Further along in this passage (80c3–6) Socrates refuses to be drawn into what Marsh McCall calls “the popular Athenian game of <i>eikazein-anteikazein</i>, in which one party asks, ‘Do you know what someone is very much like?’ and then supplies his own answer, to which the second party makes a comparison in reply. Socrates refers openly here to this Athenian pastime in his final sentence: One thing I know about all handsome people is this—they delight in being compared to something [<i>chairousin</i> <b><i>eikaz</i></b><i>omenoi</i>] … since fine features, I suppose, must have fine similes [<i>kalai gar oimai tôn kalôn kai hai <b>eikones</b></i>]. But I am not playing your game [<i>ouk ant<b>eikas</b>omai</i> <i>se</i>].” <a href="#n5" name="a5">[5]</a></p>
                        <p>At 84b this simile appears again: … “In making him confused and dizzy<i> </i>(<i>narkan</i>) <b>like</b> <b><i>a sting-ray</i></b> (<i>hôsper hê narkê</i>), surely <i>we</i> did not harm him?” (Socrates) “I don’t think so.” (Meno) … Didn’t we benefit him by making him confused<i> </i>(<i>narkêsas</i>)?” (Soc.) “I think so.” (84c) (Meno). (The benefit consisted of causing the slave boy to want to know what he did not know.)</p>
                        <p>3. “And now <i>these opinions</i> (<i>doxai</i>) have just been stirred up in him, <b>like</b> <b><i>a dream</i></b> (<i>hôsper onar</i>).” (85c) Socrates [opinions = a dream]</p>
                        <p>4. “To possess <i>one of the images of Daedalus</i> (<i>ta Daidalou agalmata</i>, 97d)—one of his works which is let loose (<i>tôn poiêmatôn lelumenon</i>)—is of little value, <b>just like</b> <b><i>a runaway slave</i></b> (<i>hôsper drapetên anthrôpon</i>, 97e). Socrates [an image of Daedalus = a runaway slave]</p>
                        <p>At 97d–98 Socrates tells Meno why knowledge (<i>epistêmê</i>) should always be more prized than right opinion (<i>orthê doxê</i>): “If a man knew the way to Larisa … and walked there and led others, would he not lead correctly? (97a) …<b> </b>What if someone had a correct opinion as to which was the way, but had never been there and did not really know, could he not also lead correctly?” (97b) “You have not carefully observed the images of Daedalus; perhaps there are none in your country.” (Socrates) “What do you mean?” (Meno) “That if they are not tied down, they run away and escape; but, if fastened, they stay where they are.” (Socrates) (97e) “It is not worth much to possess <i>one of his works</i> which is set free; it will not stay with you <b>any more than<i> a runaway slave:</i></b> but when tied down it is worth a great deal, for his productions are very fine things. And to what am I referring in saying this? I am referring to <i>true opinions</i> (<i>doxai hai alêtheîs</i>). For these, so long as they stay with us, are a fine possession, [98a] and achieve good things; but they do not stay for long, and run away out of the human soul, and thus are of no great value until one <b><i>ties them down with logic</i></b>. And this process … <b>is</b> <i>recollection</i> (<i>anamnêsis</i>) … When they are fastened, in the first place they turn into knowledge, and in the second, are lasting (<i>monimoi</i>). <i>And this is why knowledge is more valuable than right opinion</i>: knowledge (<i>epistêmê</i>) is superior to right opinion (<i>orthês doxês</i>) because of its bond. (97d–98) Socrates [true opinions = the images of Daedalus = a runaway slave] [recollection = tying true opinion down with logic]</p>

                        <p>2.

                        <p>3. “You <i>make one to be in many places at once</i> <b>just as if</b> (<i>hoîon ei</i>) you should <b><i>spread a sail over many persons</i></b> and then say it was one and all of it was over many.” (131b) Parmenides [make one to be in many places at once = spread a sail over many persons]</p>

                        <p>NB the sequel to 132d: “If anything resembles (<i>eoike</i>) the idea, can that idea (<i>eîdos</i>) avoid being like the thing which resembles it (<i>mê homoion eînai tôi eikasthenti</i>) in so far as the thing has been made to resemble it? (<i>kath’ hoson </i><em>autôi</em><i> aphômoiôthê</i>) Or is there any possibility that the like be unlike its like?” The language of simile is applied to the complex philosophical problem of this Dialogue.</p>
                        <p>5. “And yet <i>I</i> seem to have suffered the [fate] of <b><i>the Ibykeian horse</i></b> (<i>hippou</i>) a race-horse (<i>athlêtêi</i>) but rather old … to which (<i>hôi</i>) he [Ibycus] <b>compared </b>himself (<i>heauton apeikazôn</i>) … Now I too seem to dread when I remember <i>what a sea of words I have to swim though</i> <i>at my age</i> (<i>dianeûsai tosoûton pelagos logôn</i>).” (137a) Parmenides [I/Parmenides = the Ibykeian horse] This reference to the horse in Ibycus (frg. 2 Bergk) that entered a chariot race and was trembling with fear because he knew what was coming from experience reflects Parmenides’ reluctant agreement to comply with Socrates’ request (136d) to explain his method of training (<i>ho tropos tês gymnasias, </i>135d).</p>
                        <p>This ‘mixed metaphor’ of a horse-racing simile and swimming metaphor is embedded in the complex narrative structure of this Dialogue, in which Parmenides’ words are reported by Pythodorus to the elderly Antiphon, who repeats it to Cephalus, the narrator of the <i>Parmenides</i>. The analogy of <i>logos</i> as something that must be swum through occurs again at <i>Phaedrus</i> 264a, where Socrates says that Lysias does not begin at the beginning, but tries “to swim on his back up the current of his discourse from its end and begins with what the lover would say at the end to his beloved.”</p>
                        <p>6. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>things in a picture </i></b>(<i>eskiagraphêmena</i>)<b> <i>when viewed from a distance </i></b>(<i>apostanti</i>) …<b><i> appear to be alike</i> </b>(<i>homoia</i>) … but <i>when you come close, they appear to be many and different</i> (<i>anoimoia</i>).” Therefore <i>other things must appear to be like and unlike</i> …” (165c–d) Parmenides [other things must appear to be like and unlike = things in a picture when viewed from a distance, appear to be alike<b><i> </i></b>(<i>homoious</i>)<b><i> </i></b>and different<b><i> </i></b>(<i>anomoious</i>)] Parmenides’ analogy/simile contradicts young Socrates’ statement at 127e that “the unlike (<i>anomoia</i>) cannot be like (<i>homoia</i>) nor the like (<i>homoia</i>) unlike (<i>anomoia</i>).”</p>
                        <p>This Dialogue comes to a sudden conclusion after the long and complex discussion of the existence and non-existence of ‘the one’. It is surprising that in the second part of the Dialogue (137c and following: the complex argument of Parmenides) there is only one clarifying simile near the end. Perhaps it is because Socrates is not the interlocutor. The last time the speaker (Parmenides) and respondent (Aristoteles) are named is at 137c, thirty pages before the end. After <i>phanai</i> (137c) there are no names and no ‘he said’s, only a succession of words and phrases signifying agreement: <i>nai</i>,<i> panu ge</i>,<i> alêthê</i>,<i> orthôs</i>,<i> deî</i>, etc.<b></b></p>

                        <p>1. [“You seem to have a childish fear … “ (Socrates, 77d) “Perhaps there is inside us a child (<i>tis … pais</i>).] Let me try to persuade this [inner child] not to fear <i>death</i> <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) [the]<b> <i>hobgoblins</i></b> (<i>mormolukeia</i>)” (77e) Cebes [fear of death = (childish) fear of hobgoblins]</p>
                        <p>2. “<i>It </i>[<i>the soul</i>] wanders around (<i>planâtai</i>) (and is) confused and dizzy <b>just like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) [<b><i>someone</i>]<i> inebriated</i></b> (<i>methuousa</i>).” (79c) Socrates [soul = a drunk] Socrates uses the same term for the soul “wandering around” as Timaeus employs for a woman’s womb (<i>planômenon</i>) inside the body (<i>Timaeus</i> 31).</p>
                        <p>3. “When philosophy first takes possession of their soul, completely fastened and welded to the <i>body</i>, it (the soul) is forced to look at reality <b>as though</b> <b><i>through a cage</i></b> (<i>hôsper dia eirgmou</i>).” (82e) Socrates [the soul &gt; the body = a prisoner &gt; a cage]</p>
                        <p>4. “The soul of the <i>philosopher</i> would <b>not</b> think it right that philosophy … should give itself again in bondage to pleasures and pains and engage in some futile task (<i>anênuton ergon</i>) of <b><i>Penelope</i></b> (<i>Pênolopês</i>) unweaving the web she wove.” (84a) Socrates [philosopher &gt; pleasure/pain ≠ Penelope &gt; woven web] The fact that both ‘philosopher’ and ‘Penelope’ are in the genitive case strengthens the similetic comparison.</p>
                        <p>5. “And as it appears, <i>I </i>seem to you to be <b>worse</b> (<i>phauloteros</i>) at prophecy <b>than</b> the <b><i>swans</i></b> (<i>tôn kyknôn</i>), who when they perceive that they must die … then indeed sing most beautifully.” (84e) Socrates [I/Socrates = a prophet worse than swans]</p>
                        <p>Socrates continues this theme in a long passage about swans by contradicting most people who think they sing in sorrow for their own death whereas they really are rejoicing in their prophetic vision as Apollo’s birds. “I think I am a fellow servant (<i>homodoulos</i>) of the swans” (85b).</p>
                        <p>6. “Socrates …we accept the notion that <i>the soul</i> <b>is</b> a <b><i>mixture and harmony</i></b> (<i>krâsin eînai kai harmonian</i>) of these same elements [heat and cold etc.] … if then <i>the soul</i> <b>is</b> really a <b><i>kind of </i></b>(<i>tis</i>)<b><i> harmony</i></b> (<i>oûsa harmonia tis</i>) … then [it will perish like other harmonies when the instrument that produces it perishes].” (86c) Simmias [soul &gt; the body = a kind of harmony &gt; a lyre]</p>
                        <p>Later (88d) Echecrates says that he had always liked the doctrine (<i>logos</i>) that the <i>soul</i> <b>was a kind of</b> <b><i>harmony</i></b> (<i>to harmonian tina hêmôn einai tên psychên</i>).</p>
                        <p>7. “I too like Simmias need (<i>deomai</i>) some ‘figure’ (<i>eikonos</i> <i>tinos </i>= a simile or analogy), as it appears. It seems to me this could be said equally well (<i>homoiôs legesthai</i>), <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) someone might say about an <b><i>elderly weaver </i></b>(<i>peri anthrôpou hyphantou presbytou</i>) who had died that he was still alive somewhere, offering as proof <b><i>the cloak that he had woven</i></b> was still whole and had not perished (87b–c) … and I think the same figure (<i>eikona</i>) would apply to <i>the soul and the body</i>.” (87d) Cebes [the soul &gt; the body = weaver &gt; his cloak] In the ensuing discussion Cebes rejects this comparison.</p>
                        <p>8. “If you think <i>what I say</i> is true, agree to it … [or] oppose me … so that <i>I</i> may not deceive us both and go away, <b>like</b> <b><i>a bee</i></b> (<i>hôsper melitta</i>) leaving <b><i>my sting</i></b> (<i>to</i> <i>kentron</i>) sticking in you” (91c) Socrates [Socrates &gt; what he says = a bee &gt; sting)</p>
                        <p>In 91d Socrates summarizes Simmias’ and Cebes’ doubts about the immortality of the soul; then at 92a–b rejects the view that harmony is a compound (<i>to harmonian einai syntheton prâgma</i>) and that the soul is a harmony made up of elements strung together [like harpstrings] in the body. (Fowler adds the simile.) “For harmony is not what <b>your comparison</b> assumes it to be” (92b: <i>ou gar dê harmonia ge soi toioûton estin ho apeikazeis</i>). Harmony is the last to be composed and the first to perish.</p>
                        <p>9. “The <i>soul’s entrance into the human body</i> was the beginning of its dissolution, <b><i>a disease</i></b>, <b>as it were</b> (<i>hôsper nosos</i>). (95d) Socrates [the entrance of the soul into the body = a disease]</p>
                        <p>Most of the first nine similes (2–4, 6–9) are devoted to the soul: as someone drunk, a prisoner, a kind of harmony (soul &gt; the body = harmony &gt; a lyre), a weaver (soul &gt; the body = a weaver &gt; his cloak), a disease. Fourteen through nineteen describe the earth.</p>
                        <p>10 and11. “Most<i> </i>people, [<i>when they speak so confusingly</i>], <b>seem to be</b><i> <b>feeling around</b> <b>in the dark </b></i>(<i>psêlaphôntes</i>), as it were<i> </i>(<i>hôsper</i>)<i> </i>and are giving it a name that does not belong to it. Thus one person surrounds the earth with a vortex, and someone else places <i>air</i> as a support [for the earth] <b>as though</b> (<i>hôsper</i>)<i> </i>on <b><i>a flat trough</i></b>. (99b) Socrates [loose logic = groping in the dark; air &gt; earth = a flat trough &gt; (a bowl)]</p>
                        <p>12 and 13. “<i>Arguments</i> (<i>hoi logoi</i>) are <b>like</b> (<i>homoioi</i>) <b><i>men</i></b> (<i>anthrôpois</i>): when they, lacking proper knowledge about arguments, believe in an argument but later think that it is false … conclude that <i>all things</i>, including arguments, go up and down <b>like</b> (<i>atechnôs</i> <i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>the tide in the Euripus</i></b> (<i>en Euripôi anô kai katô strephetai</i>).” (99b–c) Socrates to Phaedo [arguments = men; all things = the tide in the Euripus]</p>
                        <p>14. “[I believe] <i>we</i> who live between the Pillars of Heracles and the Phasis [river] dwell in a small part [of the earth] around the sea <b>like</b><i> </i>(<i>hôsper</i>)<i> <b>ants or frogs</b> </i>around a pond (<i>peri telma myrmêkas ê batrachous</i>).” (109b) Socrates [we/Greeks around &gt; the sea = ants or frogs around &gt; a pond]</p>
                        <p>15. “If <i>anyone</i> (<i>tis</i>) should come to the top of the air … he could lift his head above it and see things in that upper world, <b>as</b> <b><i>fishes </i></b>(<i>hôsper ichthyes</i>) lift their heads out of water and see the things in our world …” (109e) Socrates [anyone = fishes]</p>
                        <p>16. “T<i>he earth</i> (<i>hê gê</i>) itself appears, if someone should look at it from above, <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) those <b><i>twelve-patch leather balls</i></b> (<i>dôdekaskytoi sphaîrai</i>) variegated …” (110b) Socrates [earth = leather ball (in appearance)]</p>
                        <p>17. “It is divided into patches of various <i>colors</i> (<i>poikilê chrômasin dieilêmmenê</i>) of which the colors which we see here may be regarded <b>as</b> <b><i>samples</i></b> (<i>hôsper deigmata</i>) which (<i>hoîa</i>) painters (<i>grapheîs</i>) use.” (110b) Socrates [colors there = samples here]</p>
                        <p>18. “Some of the <i>streams</i> in the earth pass completely around in a circle, coiling about the earth <b>like</b> <b><i>serpents</i></b> (<i>hôsper hoi opheis</i>).” (112e) Socrates [streams = serpents]</p>
                        <p>19. “The fourth river issues … having a [dark-blue] <i>colour</i> all over <b>like</b> <b><i>cyanos</i></b> (<i>chrôma d’ echonta holon hoîon ho kyanos</i>).” (113b) Socrates [colour = cyanos (<i>lapis lazuli</i>)]</p>
                        <p>20. “We felt <b><i>he</i></b> (<b><i>Socrates</i></b>) was truly <b>like</b> (<i>atechnôs hôsper</i>)<i> </i>a <b><i>father</i></b> to us and that when bereft of him <i>we</i> should pass the rest of our lives [<b>as</b>] <b><i>orphans</i></b> (<i>orphanoi</i>).” (116a) Phaedo [Socrates &gt; us = father &gt; sons; we = orphans]</p>

                        <p>Many of the similes in this Dialogue describe the soul, the relationship between lovers, and speech writing (24–31).</p>
                        <p>1–2. “I examine not these things but myself (<i>emauton</i>) to know whether <i>I</i> <b>happen to be</b> (<i>on</i> <i>tyngchanô</i>) <b><i>some</i></b> <b><i>beast</i></b> (<i>ti thêrion</i>) more complex (<i>polyplokôteron</i>) and wilder (<i>mâllon epitethymmenon</i>) [than] <b><i>Typhon</i></b> (<i>Typhônos</i>).” (230a) Socrates [I = some beast = Typhon]</p>
                        <p>3. “You seem to have found the drug (<i>to pharmakon</i>) to entice me out here. For <b>just as </b>(<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>people lead hungry animals</i></b> (<i>ta peinônta thremmata</i>) <b><i>around by holding out a branch or some fruit</i></b> (<i>thallon ê tina karpon</i>) in front of them, so <i>you, holding out speeches</i> (<i>logous</i>) <i>to me thus in books</i>, <i>will no doubt lead me around</i> all of Attica and wherever else you wish.” (230d) Socrates [I/Socrates &gt; a book = a hungry animal &gt; fruit]</p>
                        <p>4. “The only alternative, I think, is that <i>I</i> have been filled somehow from other sources through my hearing, <b>like</b><i> <b>a pitcher</b> </i>(<i>dikên angeiou</i>, 235d).” Socrates [I/ Socrates = a pitcher]</p>
                        <p>5. “<b>As</b> (<i>hôs</i>) <b><i>wolves</i></b> (<i>lykoi</i>) <b><i>love a</i></b> <b><i>lamb</i></b> (<i>arnas</i>) so (<i>hôs</i>) <i>lovers adore a beloved</i>.” (241d) Socrates, quoting a verse of hexameter poetry [a lover &gt; a beloved = a wolf &gt; a lamb]</p>
                        <p>In contrast to this cynical view of the lover in Socrates’ first speech, in his palinode (244–257b) he presents an idealized picture, with the lover worshiping the god-like face of his loved one <i>like a god</i> (251a: <i>hôs theon sebetai</i>) and treating him <i>like a god</i> (253a: <i>homoiotaton tôi spheterôi theôi</i> and 255a: <i>hôs isotheos</i>). Thus the climax of this description of love is reported in a stream of vivid similes. [the beloved = a god]</p>
                        <p>6. “Concerning <i>its </i>[<i>the soul</i>’s] <i>form </i>this much may be said. To tell what it really is would require an utterly superhuman (<i>pantêi pantôs theias</i>) and long discourse, but it is within human power to describe it briefly <i>in a figure</i> (<i>hôi de eoiken</i>). Let <i>it</i> be <b>compared to</b> (<i>eoiketô</i>) the <b><i>composite power</i></b> <b><i>of a winged yoke of horses and a charioteer</i></b> (<i>symphytôi dynamei hypopterou zeugous te kai hêniochou</i>).” Socrates (246a; more at 253d ff.) [soul = a winged yoke of horses and charioteer]</p>
                        <p>There follows the long description of the human soul, which we would now call an allegory, although introduced by this simile, which (Socrates says) substitutes for an almost impossible discourse. Hence the value of a good simile!</p>
                        <p>7. “[The fourth kind of madness is] when [<i>the lover</i>] seeing beauty and feeling his wings growing, longs to stretch them for an upward flight but cannot do so, and … <b>like</b><i> <b>a bird</b></i> (<i>ornithos dikên</i>) gazing upward, neglects the things below.” (249d) Socrates [lover = a bird]</p>
                        <p>8. “Being pure and not buried in this which we carry around and call body, <i>we</i> are imprisoned (<i>dedesmeumenoi</i>) <b>like</b> <b><i>an oyster</i></b> (<i>ostreou tropon</i>).” (250c) Socrates [we &gt; (imprisoned in our bodies) = oysters &gt; (in their shells)]</p>
                        <p>9. “But giving himself up to pleasure <b>like</b><i> <b>a beast</b></i> (<i>tetrapodos nomon</i>) <i>he</i> proceeds to fornication and begetting children.” (250d) Socrates [man devoted to pleasure = a beast]</p>
                        <p>10. “But he who is newly initiated …, when he sees a godlike face or some form of a body which is a good image of beauty, shudders at first, and … then, as he gazes, he reveres <i>him</i> <b>as</b> <b><i>a god</i></b> (<i>hôs theon sebetai</i>) and if he did not fear to be thought stark mad, he would offer sacrifice to <i>his beloved</i> <b>as</b> <b>to <i>an idol or a god</i></b> (<i>thyoi an hôs agalmati kai theôi tois paidikoi</i>s)” (251a) Socrates [beloved = a god = an idol (<i>agalma</i>)]</p>
                        <p>A minor simile follows in the next sentence: “And a <i>change</i> (<i>metabolê</i>) takes over him as he looks <b>as though</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>from shivering</i></b> (<i>ek tês phrikês</i>).”</p>
                        <p>11. “Now in this process the whole soul throbs and palpates, and <i>whatever</i> pain (<i>hoper to … pathos</i>) those feel around their gums when their teeth begin to grow <b>is the same</b> (<i>tauton dê</i>) that the soul suffers where the growth of feathers begins.” (251b–c) Socrates [pain of the soul with growth of feathers = cutting teeth]</p>
                        <p>12. “The <i>feather-sprouts</i> … throb <b>like</b> <b><i>pulsing arteries</i></b> (<i>hoion ta sphyzonta</i>). (251d) Socrates [feather-sprouts = pulsing arteries]</p>
                        <p>13. “In addition to revering <i>him who possesses beauty</i>, <i>he<b> </b></i><b>finds</b> (<i>hêurêke</i>) [in <i>him</i>] the <b><i>only healer of his greatest woes</i></b> (<i>iatron monon</i>).” (252b) Socrates [he who has beauty = the only healer of his woes]</p>
                        <p>14. “The lover fashions and adorns [<i>his beloved</i>] <b>like</b> <b><i>a statue</i></b> (<i>hoion agalma</i>) <b>as though</b> he were his <b><i>god </i></b>(<i>hôs theon auton</i>).” (252d) Socrates [beloved = a statue of a god]</p>
                        <p>15. “Considering the beloved the cause of this, <i>they</i> [lovers] revere him still more, and even pray to (draw inspiration from) Zeus <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>Bacchants</i></b> (<i>bakchai</i>). (253a) Socrates [lovers = Bacchants]</p>
                        <p>16. “The <i>charioteer</i> (<i>ho hêniochos</i>) … falls back <b>like</b> <b><i>a racer from the starting-rope</i></b> (<i>hôsper apo hysplêgos anapesôn</i>).” (254e) Socrates [charioteer of the soul = a racer]</p>
                        <p>17. “Devoting all service [to his <i>beloved</i>] <b>as to</b><i> <b>a god</b> </i>(<i>hôs isotheos</i>).” (255a) Socrates [beloved = a god]</p>
                        <p>18. “Then the source of this flow, which Zeus in his passion for Ganymede named <i>desire</i> … <b>like</b> a <b><i>breath or some echo</i></b> (<i>hoion pneuma ê tis êchô</i>) … is carried back whence it arose, so the flow of beauty (<i>hôs to tou kallous rheuma</i>) goes back to the beautiful through the eyes<i> </i>…” (255c) Socrates [desire = a breath or an echo]</p>
                        <p>19–20. “<b>Like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) one who has caught an <i>eye disease</i> from someone [and] cannot explain it, thus he is aware of seeing himself <b>in his lover’s </b>[<b>eyes</b>] <b>as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>in a mirror</i></b> (<i>katoptrôi</i>).” (255d). Socrates [(love) = catching an eye disease (i.e. without contact); seeing oneself in one’s lover’s eyes = seeing oneself in a mirror]</p>
                        <p>21–23. “Now if they [<i>the singing cicadas</i> (<i>hoi tettiges aidontes</i>)] should see <i>us</i> … not conversing at mid-day but lulled to sleep by their song because of our mental laziness, they would quite justly laugh at us, <b>considering us </b>[<b>to be</b>] (<i>hêgoumenoi</i>) <b><i>some slaves</i></b> (<i>andrapod’ atta</i>) coming … to sleep around the fountain at noon <b>like</b> <b><i>sheep</i></b> (<i>hôsper probatia</i>). But if they see us conversing and sailing past <i>them</i> <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>Sirens</i></b> (<i>Seirênas</i>) unmoved, perhaps they will be pleased and give us the gift which they have from the gods to give to men.” (259a–b) Socrates [us/Socrates and Phaedrus = some slaves; = sheep; the cicadas = Sirens]</p>
                        <p>24. “But I do think you will agree to this, <i>that every discourse</i> (<i>panta logon</i>) must be organized <b>like</b> a <b><i>living being</i></b> (<i>hôsper zôion</i>) having a body of its own, as it were (<i>sôma ti echonta</i>), so as not to be headless (<i>akephalon</i>) or footless (<i>apoun</i>), but to have a middle and members, composed in fitting relation to each other and to the whole.” (264c) Socrates [every discourse = a living being]</p>
                        <p>25. “You will find that <i>it</i> [<i>Lysias’ speech</i>] is <b>no different from</b> (<i>ouden diapheronta</i>) <b><i>the inscription</i></b> (<i>tou epigrammatos</i>) that some say is inscribed on the tomb of Midas the Phrygian.” (264d) Socrates [Lysias’ speech = an inscription] Socrates explains that, as this inscription can be read in any order, so Lysias’ speech is haphazardly arranged.</p>
                        <p>26. “[<i>The other principle </i>(<i>eidos</i>)<i> </i>is] dividing things by categories (<i>eidê</i>) where the joints occur naturally (<i>kat’ arthra hêi pephyken</i>), and <b>not</b> trying to hack off any part (<i>katagnynai meros mêden</i>) [of a definition of love] <b>using the manner</b> of <b><i>a bad butcher</i></b> (<i>kakoû mageirou tropôi chrômenon</i>).” (265e) Socrates [one ≠ a clumsy butcher]</p>

                        <p>“Sophocles would say that this person knew <b>the preliminaries</b> (<i>ta pro tragôidias</i>) but not <b>the elements</b> (<i>ou ta tragika</i>) of tragedy.” (269a)</p>
                        <p>28–29. “At any rate, a <i>procedure</i> (<i>methodos</i>) without these [considerations] <b>would be like</b> (<i>eoikoi an hôsper</i>) the <b><i>progress of a blind man</i></b> (<i>typhlou poreiai</i>). Yet surely <i>he who pursues any study </i>(<i>technê</i>)<i> scientifically </i><b>ought not to be comparable</b> (<i>ou mên apeikasteon</i>) <b>to<i> a blind or a deaf man</i></b> (<i>typhlôi oude kôphôi</i>).” (270d) Socrates [procedure = the progress of a blind man; a student ≠ a blind or deaf man]</p>

                        <p>Specifically, similes 2 and 8–13 are devoted to describing pleasure.</p>
                        <p>1. “Thus our <i>argumen</i>t (<i>logos</i>) <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>a story </i></b>(myth) would perish.” (14a) Socrates [argument (<i>logos</i>) = a story (<i>mythos</i>)] Socrates persuades Protarchus to agree that forms of knowledge, like pleasures, are many and different.</p>
                        <p>2. “If you had no memory, you would not know whether you were enjoying your pleasures or not … you would <b>not</b> be able to lead the <i>life of a man</i> <b>but of<i> some mollusc</i></b><i> </i>(<i>pleumonos</i>)<i> <b>or other</b> </i><b>such</b><i> </i>(<i>hosa</i>)<i> <b>sea creature</b></i> (<i>thalattia</i>)<i> </i><b>as</b><i> <b>a shellfish</b></i> (<i>ostreinôn</i>). (21b–d) Socrates [life of a man = [life] of a mollusc or shellfish]</p>
                        <p>3. “It appears [that we will] need (<i>deîn</i>) <i>another contrivance/weapon</i> (<i>allês mêchanês</i>) to advance to the second level in behalf of mind (<i>hyper noû</i>), <b>like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>arrows</i></b> (<i>belê</i>) different from those of our previous discussion (<i>toû emprosthen logoû</i>).” (23b) Socrates [weapon = arrows]</p>
                        <p>4. “All philosophers (<i>hoî sophoi</i>) agree that <i>mind</i> (<i>noûs</i>) <b>is</b> (<i>esti</i>) <b><i>king</i></b> (<i>basileus</i>) of heaven and earth (<i>ouranoû te kai gês</i>).” (28c) Socrates [mind = king] Again at 30d Socrates says that “it has long been believed that mind always <b>rules</b> the universe (<i>aei toû pantos noûs <b>archei</b></i>).” Then he adds, “sometimes a joke (<i>paidia</i>) is a restful change (<i>anapaula</i>) from serious talk (<i>tês spoudês</i>)” (30e).</p>
                        <p>5. “Our <i>soul</i> then seems (<i>dokei</i>) to <b>resemble</b> <b><i>some book</i></b> (<i>hê psychê bibliôi tini proseikenai</i>).” (38e) Socrates [soul = a book: because memory (<i>mnêmê</i>), combined with our senses (<i>aisthêseis</i>) and feelings (<i>pathêmata</i>), almost seems to write words in our souls] Cf. 39b: A painter (<i>zôgraphon</i>) paints pictures (<i>eikonas</i>) in our souls to illustrate the words which the writer has written. (Socrates)</p>
                        <p>6. “Let <i>us</i>, <b>like</b> <b><i>athletes</i></b> (<i>kathaper athlêtai</i>) approach and grapple with this new argument.” (41b) Socrates [us = athletes] i.e. we must prove that false pleasures exist in us (41a).</p>
                        <p>7. Socrates quotes (47e) Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> (18.109–110), which contains a simile: “[<i>anger</i>] which stirs even a wise man (<i>polyphrona per</i>) to wrath and is <b>much sweeter than</b> <b><i>honey</i></b> dripping down (<i>hos te poly glykiô melitos kataleibomenoio</i>) [anger = honey]</p>
                        <p>8–9. “Moreover <i>we</i> are <b>like</b> (<i>kathaper</i>) <b><i>wine-pourers</i></b> (<i>hêmîn oinochoois tisi</i>) standing<i> near [two] fountains</i> (<i>krênai</i>): <i>one of honey</i> (<i>melitos</i>) and the other of <i>pure, healthy water </i>(<i>hydatos</i>). One <b>could compare</b> (<i>apeikazoi</i>) the former to a [<b><i>fountain</i></b>]<b><i> of pleasure</i> </b>(<i>hêdonês</i>), the other to a sober, wineless [<i>fountain</i>]<i> of wisdom</i> (<i>phronêseôs</i>).” (61c) Socrates [we = wine-pourers; two fountains: honey = fountain of pleasure; water = fountain of wisdom]</p>
                        <p>10. “Do you wish, then, that <i>I</i>, <b>like</b> <b><i>some doorkeeper</i></b> (<i>hôsper thyrôros tis</i>) pushed and shoved by a mob, allow all kinds of knowledge (<i>pasas tas epistêmas</i>) to flow in through the open doors?” (62c) Socrates [I/Socrates = a doorkeeper]</p>
                        <p>11. “But you must consider the true and <i>pure pleasures</i> (<i>hêdonas alêtheis kai katharas</i>) almost our own by nature (<i>oikeias</i>) … and especially all thoses which follow <i>virtue</i> <b>as though</b> <b><i>handmaids of</i></b> <b><i>a god</i></b> (<i>aretês hoposai kathaper theoû opadoi</i>).” (63e) Socrates [pure pleasures &gt; virtue = handmaids &gt; a god]</p>
                        <p>12. “Pleasure (<i>hêdonê</i>) is the greatest of impostors (<i>alazonistatôn</i>) … and in the pleasures of love (<i>ta aphrodisia</i>) which are said to be greatest, perjury (<i>to</i> <i>epiorkeîn</i>) is even pardoned by the gods, <b>as if</b> the <i>pleasures</i> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> <b><i>children</i></b> (<i>hôs kathaper paidôn tôn hêdonôn</i>) utterly devoid of all sense.” (63e) Protarchus [pleasures = children]</p>
                        <p>13. “<i>Trusting in them</i> [cows and horses and all the other animals] <b>as</b> <b><i>augurs</i></b> (<i>hôsper manteis</i>) [<b><i>trust in</i></b>] <b><i>birds</i></b> (<i>ornisin</i>), <i>most people</i> judge that pleasures [are the greatest blessings in life]. (67b) Socrates [most people &gt; animals (like cows) = augurs &gt; birds] They think the lusts of beasts are better witnesses than the words inspired by the philosophic muses.</p>
                        <p>Two proverbs may be cited: Promarchus tells Socrates not to disturb Philebus <span style="line-height: 1.5em">and ask him a question because it is better “to let sleeping dogs lie” (Fowler’s metaphorical translation, 217, of the phrase </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">mê kineîn eû keimenon</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> at 15c); and Socrates says (16c) that the ‘road’ (</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">hê hodos</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">) of argument is not at all difficult to point out but very difficult to follow” (</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">hên dêlôsai men ou pany chalepon, chrêsthai de pangchalepon</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">).</span></p>

                        <p><b>Protagoras</b> (St I.309a–362a) = W. R. M. Lamb, LCL 1977 (1924) [Plato II]</p>
                        <p><i>Sophists and the teachability of virtue.</i></p>
                        <p>1. “<i>Protagoras</i> was enchanting [them] with his voice <b>like</b> <b><i>Orpheus</i></b> (<i>hôsper</i> <i>Orpheus</i>).” (315a) Socrates [Protagoras = Orpheus] Cf. 316e: “they used their arts [as] outer coverings (<i>parapetasmasin</i>).”</p>
                        <p>2. “<i>They</i> (the children of Pericles) go around grazing <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>sacred cattle</i></b> [to see if they can stumble upon virtue/<i>aretê</i> by themselves].” (<i>aphetoi</i> = cattle ‘let loose’ from work and dedicated to a god) (320a) Socrates [Pericles’ children = sacred cows]</p>
                        <p>3. “No one punishes [a] <i>wrong-doer</i>(<i>s</i>) [merely] because he did wrong, unless he punishes him unreasonably <b>like</b> <b><i>a beast</i></b> (<i>hôsper thêrion</i>)<i> </i>… he thinks virtue is teachable (<i>paideotên einai aretên</i>), therefore he punishes to deter.” (324a–b) Protagoras [wrongdoer = a beast]</p>
                        <p>4. “(If he does not obey) they treat <i>him</i> (the boy, <i>ho pais</i>) <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) a bent and twisted <b><i>piece of wood</i></b> (<i>xylon</i>).” (325d) Protagoras [the boy = a piece of wood]</p>
                        <p>5. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>atechnôs</i> <i>hôsper</i>) the <b><i>writing masters</i></b> (<i>hoi grammatistai</i>) <b><i>first draw letters</i></b> in faint outline with the pen for their less advanced pupils etc… <i>so</i> (<i>hôs</i>) <i>the city sketches out for them the laws</i> devised by good lawgivers of yore …” (326d) Protagoras [the city &gt; laws = writing masters &gt; letters]</p>
                        <p>N.B. Protagoras’ analogy at 327e: “Everyone is a teacher of <i>arete</i> … just as if (<i>hôsper an ei</i>) you asked ‘Who is a teacher of Greek?’ you wouldn’t find one.”</p>
                        <p>6–7. “If some question is asked of one of them [<i>public speakers</i>], they are <b>just like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>books</i></b> (<i>biblia</i>) and cannot answer or ask questions on their own … but … <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>brass gongs</i></b> (<i>ta chalkia plêgenta</i>) when struck ring for a long time …” (329a) Socrates [public speakers = books = brass gongs]</p>
                        <p>8–9. “Are the <i>parts of virtue</i> <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>parts of the face</i></b> (mouth and nose and eyes and ears), or <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>parts of gold</i></b> with no differences between the parts except in size?” (329d) Socrates [virtue ? = the face or = gold] Protagoras replies that the parts of virtue (<i>ta tês aretês moria</i>) are like parts of the face (<i>ta toû prosôpou moria</i>).</p>
                        <p>10. “But now it is <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) if you should ask <i>me </i>to keep up with the Himeraian [runner] <b><i>Kriso</i></b> in his prime or to race one of the long-distance runners.” (335e) Socrates [I/Socrates <b>≠</b> runner Kriso]</p>
                        <p>“If you want to see us run together, you must ask him to adapt his pace since I cannot run fast but he can run slowly. Thus if you want to have Protagoras and me, ask him to resume the method he used at first—in short sentences and keeping to the point.”</p>
                        <p>NB the punning way that Alcibiades addresses Callias: “You do not state the matter well (<i>kalôs</i>), Callias (<i>ô Kallia</i>).” Socrates refers to himself in the <i>Apology</i> (39b) as old and slow (<i>bradys ôn kai presbytês</i>), who is caught by death, whereas his accusers could not escape wickedness (<i>ponêria</i>) which runs faster than death (<i>thâtton gar thanatou thei</i>).</p>
                        <p>11. “For like is related to like by nature, but <i>custom</i>, <b>being</b> (<i>ôn</i>) a <b><i>tyrant</i></b> over men, overpowers many things contrary to nature.” (337d) Hippias [custom = a tyrant]</p>
                        <p>Lamb (179n2) notes Hippias’ “frequent metaphors … designed to display his wide range of knowledge.” He advises Socrates to “loosen the reins to his speeches” (338a) and tells Protagoras not to “let loose your sails” in “the sea of words”; he advises them “to choose an umpire (<i>rhabdouchon</i>, 338a).”</p>
                        <p>12. “If you choose [an umpire] who is not superior to Protagoras—but you say he is—this too would be shameful for him, <b>as if</b> <i>he</i> were some <b><i>simple soul</i></b> (<i>hôsper phaulôi</i>) requiring a supervisor.” (338c) Socrates [Protagoras = some simple soul]</p>
                        <p>13. “And <i>I</i> at first, <b>just as if</b><i> </i>(<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>having been hit by a good boxer</i></b> (<i>hypo</i> <i>agathoû pyktou</i>), was blinded and dizzy when he [Protagoras expounding a poem by Simonides] had said this and the others had shouted their approval.” (339e) Socrates [I/Socrates = someone hit by a good boxer]</p>
                        <p>14. “Then, it seems, I have blundered badly, Protagoras, and <i>I</i> am [<i>eimi tis</i>] <b><i>some ridiculous physician</i></b>, trying to cure [but] making the disease greater.” (340d–e) Socrates [I/Socrates = a bad physician]</p>
                        <p>15. “If <i>he</i> (<i>Simonides</i>) <i>could overthrow </i>(<i>katheloi</i>) <i>this famous saying</i>, <b>as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>)<i> </i>[<b><i>one might conquer</i></b>]<b><i> a famous athlete</i></b>, … he would win fame for himself.” (343c) Socrates [Simonides &gt; this famous saying = someone &gt; a famous athlete] The ‘famous saying’ was Pittacus’ that “it is hard to be good” (<i>to chalepon esthlon emmenai</i>).</p>
                        <p>16–17. “All these [five] <i>parts of virtue</i> are <b>not</b><i> </i><b>like</b><i> <b>pieces of gold</b></i> similar to (<i>homoia</i>) one another and to the whole of which they are parts,<i> </i>but<i> </i><b>like</b><i> the <b>parts of the face</b></i> (<i>ta tou prosôpou moria</i>) … dissimilar (<i>anomia</i>) to each other.” (349c) <a href="#n6" name="a6">[6]</a> Socrates Cf. #16–17 above and 330a–b where the comparison includes the clause ‘if it is similar to the analogy’ (<i>eiper tôi paradeigmati ge eoiken</i>) [virtue (≠ gold) = the face]</p>
                        <p>18. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>)<i> <b>in examining a man’s health from his appearance</b></i> (<i>ek tou eidou</i>) … one might say, ‘Come now, uncover (<i>ithi dê moi apokalupson</i>) your chest too <span style="line-height: 1.5em">… so that I may examine you thoroughly’ … </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">I would like to make a similar examination of you, Protagoras</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> … and say, ‘Come now, uncover</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em"> </i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">(</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">ithi dê moi apokalupsas</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> your inner thoughts (</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">tês dianoias</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">).’” (352a) Socrates [Socrates &gt; Protagoras’ inner self = someone &gt; a physical examination]</span></p>
                        <p>19. “Many people think … of <i>knowledge </i>(<i>epistêmês</i>) <b>as</b> <b><i>a slave</i></b> (<i>hôsper peri andrapodou</i>) dragged around by all the other [forces].” (352c) Socrates [knowledge = a slave]</p>
                        <p>20. “<b>Like</b> a <b><i>practised weigher</i></b> (<i>hôsper agathos histanai anthrôpos</i>) [<i>you</i>] put pleasant things and painful things in the scale … and tell me which counts for more.” (356b) Socrates [Protagoras evaluating pleasure and pain = a practised ‘weigher’]</p>
                        <p>The science of weighing (<i>hê metrêtêkê technê</i>) versus the power of appearances (<i>hê tou phainomenou dynamis</i>). “Which is our salvation? Is it not the latter that leads us astray?” (356d)</p>
                        <p>21. “The <i>outcome of our discussion</i> just now seems to me to accuse and laugh at us <b>like</b> <b><i>a man</i></b> (<i>hôsper anthrôpos</i>)” (361a) Socrates [discussion (<i>logos</i>) = a person laughing at us]<b></b></p>

                        <p>1. “It seems to me that we should learn from <i>them </i>[<i>the very age</i>d], <b>as it were</b> (<i>hôsper</i>), from <b><i>traveler</i></b>s (<i>tina hodon proelêluthotôn</i>) who have preceded us on a road on which we too perhaps must eventually go.” (328e) Socrates [the very aged = experienced travelers]</p>
                        <p>2. “Hush, sir, he [Sophocles] said; most gladly have I escaped <i>this thing </i>(<i>ta</i> <i>aphrodisia</i>, [<i>sexual pleasure</i>]), <b>as if</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) I had run away from a <b><i>raging and savage beast of a master</i> </b>(<i>agrian despotên</i>).” (329c) Cephalus [sexual pleasure = a raging and savage master]</p>
                        <p>3. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>poets</i></b> love their own poems and <b><i>fathers</i></b> their sons, so (<i>tautêi</i>) <i>men who have made money</i> (<i>chrêmatisamenoi</i>) … value their money as their own creation.” (330c) Socrates [money men &gt; money = poets &gt; poems = fathers &gt; sons]</p>
                        <p>4. “When a man leads his life justly and piously, ‘<i>hope</i> (<i>elpis</i>) accompanies him [<b>as</b>] <b><i>a sweet nurse</i> <i>of old age</i> </b>(<i>glykeia … gêrotrophos</i>) to cheer his heart.’” (331a) Cephalus quoting Pindar (frg. 214) [hope = sweet nurse of old age]</p>
                        <p>5. “A <b><i>kind of thief</i></b> (<i>kleptês tis</i>), then, <b>as it seems</b> (<i>hôs eoiken</i>), the <i>just man</i> (<i>ho</i> <i>dikaios</i>) has been revealed to be (<i>anapephantai</i>) … Then <i>justice</i> <b>seems to be</b> (<i>hôs eoiken</i>), according to you and Homer and Simonides, a <b><i>kind of stealing</i></b> (<i>kleptikê tis</i>).” (334a–b) Socrates to Polemarchus, who admits <i>aporia</i> at 334b: “I no longer know what I meant.” His confusion was no doubt influenced by Socrates’ punning paradox (at the end of 333d) that “justice … is useless (<i>achrêstos</i>) but in its uselessness it is useful (<i>en de achrêstiai chrêsimos</i>).” [justice = stealing; just man = thief] Socrates adds an explanation (334e) that “justice cannot be very valuable (<i>spoudaîon</i>) if it is useful only for things that are useless (<i>ta achrêsta chrêsimon</i>).”</p>
                        <p>6. “But gathering himself up <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) a <b><i>wild beast</i></b>, <i>he </i>[<i>Thrasymachus</i>] hurled himself upon us as if he would tear us to pieces.” (336b) Socrates [Thrasymachus = a wild beast]</p>
                        <p>7. “We are searching for <i>justice</i> (<i>dikaiosynên</i>), a thing <b>more precious than</b> (<i>timiôteron</i>) <b><i>much fine gold</i></b> (<i>pollôn chrysiôn</i>).” (336e) Socrates [justice = much fine gold]</p>
                        <p>8. “Saying this <i>Thrasymachus</i> intended to depart, <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>a bathman</i></b> (<i>balaneus</i>), having poured his long and dense speech all over our ears.” (344d) Socrates [Thrasymachus = a bathman]</p>
                        <p>Paul Shorey (LCL <i>Republic</i> vol. 1, 71) points out the metaphor in the verb <i>katantleo</i> by citing <i>Republic</i> 536b, <i>Lysis</i> 204d (where Ctesippus jokes about Hippothales “<i>inundating</i> us with his poems about Lysis”) and Aristophanes’ <i>Wasps</i> 483. Socrates changes the metaphor in the next section when he says that Thrasymachus &#8220;hurled such an argument (<i>logos</i>) at them before leaving.”</p>
                        <p>9. Socrates urges Thrasymachus to be consistent in his argument about a true shepherd, whereas Thrasymachus sometimes says that “the <i>shepherd</i> herds his sheep (<i>probata</i>) not with regard for what is best for the sheep, but <b>as if</b> he were a <b><i>banqueter</i></b> (<i>hôsper daitymona</i>) … <b>or as</b> a <b><i>money-maker</i></b> (<i>hôsper chrêmtistên</i>) with a view to selling them.” (345c) Socrates [shepherd = a banqueter or money-maker]</p>
                        <p>10. “Either allow me to speak at such length as I desire or, if <i>you</i> prefer to ask questions, go on questioning and I, <b>as</b> we do for <b><i>old wives</i></b> telling their tales (<i>hôsper taîs grausi tous mythous legousais</i>), will say, ‘Very good!’ and will not assent and desist.” (350e) Thrasymachus [you/Socrates = an old wife]</p>
                        <p>11. “With this [I hope] <i>you have feasted</i> well at the Festival of Bendis, Socrates.” “… I have not <i>dined</i> well at all, Thrasymachus, I said, not through your fault but through my own. But <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>gluttons</i></b> (<i>lichnoi</i>) who seize and taste [every plate of food] that is passed along before properly enjoying the earlier dish, <i>I </i>also seem to be like that here.” (354b) Socrates [I/Socrates = glutton] Here Socrates continues Thrasymachus’ metaphor of <i>feasting</i> as <i>conversing,</i> adding a simile about gluttons. See also Shorey’s note at 352b (99n<i>d</i>) about the image of the feast of reason: cf. 354a–b, <i>Lysis</i> 211c, <i>Gorgias</i> 522e, <i>Phaedrus</i> 227b and <i>Timaeus</i> 17a.</p>

                        <p>2. “How strenuously you [Glaucon] polish off each (<i>ekateron</i>) of your two men for the competition for the <i>prize</i> <b>as if it were</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>a statue</i></b> (<i>andriata</i>).” (361d) Socrates [prize = a statue] cf. <i>Republic</i><b> </b>[7–19] (540c).</p>
                        <p>3. “I think we should employ the <i>method of search</i> (<i>zêtêsin</i>) <b>that we should use if<i> </i></b>(<i>hoianper</i>) we, with not very keen vision, were<b><i> asked to read small letters from a distance </i></b>…” (368d) Socrates [method of search = reading small letters at a distance]</p>
                        <p>There follows the analogy of studying justice in a city rather than in a person to see better the origin of justice and injustice in a <i>polis</i>.</p>
                        <p>4. “Do you think that the nature of <b><i>a well-bred dog</i></b> (<i>gennaiou skylakos</i>) for guard duty (<i>phylakên</i>) <b>differs from</b> (<i>diapherein</i>) [that] of <i>a well-bred young man </i>(<i>neaniskou</i> <i>eugenous</i>)?” (375a) Socrates [well-bred young man = well-bred dog] The guardians will be like well-bred hounds, gentle to those they know but ferocious to those they do not know (375e).</p>
                        <p>See Book 5.6 (469d–e) below. In contrast to this picture of the <i>well-bred dog</i>, in Book 5 Socrates suggests a comparison between people who plunder a corpse on the battlefield and <i>dogs who snarl</i> at stones thrown at them but do not attack the one who throws the stones.</p>
                        <p>5. At 375d Socrates says that “we have lost sight of the comparison (<i>eikonos</i>) that we set before ourselves.” “Let us <i>procee</i>d <b>as if</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>we were telling stories</i></b> (<i>en mythôi mythologountes</i>) and had ample leisure.” (376d) Socrates [process = telling stories]</p>
                        <p>6. “Which type of story (<i>mythos</i>) do you blame, Socrates?” (Adeimantos) “The kind you should blame first, especially if the lie is a pretty one (<i>mê kalôs speudêtai</i>) … <i>when one portrays badly</i> (<i>eikazêi tis kakôs</i>) <i>the true nature of the gods</i>, <b>just a</b>s (<i>hôsper</i>) a <b><i>painter</i></b> (<i>graphôs</i>) <b><i>whose portraits bear no resemblence to his models</i></b>.” (377e) Socrates [false portrayer of the gods = bad painter] Painters are the vehicle also in <i>Republic</i> 6.1 and 6.4.</p>

                        <p>1. “Wherever the <i>argument</i> (<i>logos</i>), <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) the <b><i>wind</i></b> (<i>pneûma</i>), carries [us], there we must go.” (394d) Socrates [argument = the wind]</p>
                        <p>2. “If we <b>likened</b> (<i>apeikazontes</i>) that kind of<i> food </i>(<i>sitêsin</i>)<i> and regimen </i>(<i>diaitan</i>) to <b><i>music and song</i></b> (<i>melopoiiai te kai ôidêi</i>) … it would be a fair comparison (<i>orthôs apeikazoimen</i>).” (404d–e) Socrates [food and regimen = music and song]</p>
                        <p>3. <i>“</i>To fill <i>ourselves</i> up with with humours and winds<i> </i><b>like</b><i> </i>(<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>swamps</i></b><i> </i>(<i>limnas</i>) <i>… </i>don’t you think that’s disgraceful<i>?”</i> (405d) Socrates [our bodies = swamps]</p>
                        <p>4–5. “When a man abandons himself to music (<i>mousikêi</i>) and <i>pours into his soul</i> (<i>katachein tês psychês</i>) <b>as it were</b> <b><i>through the funnel of his ears</i></b> (<i>dia tôn otôn hôsper dia chônês</i>) these sweet … soft harmonies (<i>harmonias</i>), the first result is that … his <i>high spirit</i> (<i>thymoeides</i>) … is softened <b>like</b> <b><i>iron</i></b> (<i>hôsper sidêron emalaxe</i>) … until he dissolves his spirit and cuts out <i>as it were</i> (<i>hôsper</i>) the tendons from his soul …” (411a–b) Socrates [ears = funnels; high spirit = iron]</p>
                        <p>6. “<i>Such a man</i> (who has had no contact with music) becomes a misologist and stranger to music (<i>misologos kai amousos</i>) … and achieves all his ends (<i>pros panta diaprattetai</i>) <b>like</b> a <b><i>beast</i></b> (<i>hôsper thêrion</i>) by violence and savagery.” (411d) Socrates [such a man = beast]</p>
                        <p>7–8. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>men accustom</i></b> <b><i>colts</i></b> (<i>tous pôlous</i>) to noises and uproar to see if they are able to take fright, <b>so</b> (<i>houtô</i>) <i>we must bring</i> <i>these lads</i> while young (<i>neous ontas</i>) into fears … and to pleasures testing [<i>them</i>] (<i>basanizontes</i>) <b>much more carefully than</b> men do <b><i>gold</i></b> in the fire (<i>poly mâllon ê chryson en pyri</i>)<i>.”</i> (413d) Socrates [men &gt; colts = we &gt; these lads = men &gt; gold]</p>
                        <p>9–10. “The <i>earth</i> (<i>hê gê</i>) delivered them [the Athenians] <b>being</b> (<i>oûsa</i> = as] <b><i>a mother</i></b> (<i>mêtêr</i>) and now they ought to take thought for their <i>land</i> <b>as if</b> (<i>hôs</i>) [it were] their <b><i>mother and nurse</i></b> (<i>peri mêtros kai trophou</i>) … and consider the other <i>citizens</i> (<i>tôn allôn politôn</i>) <b>as</b> (<i>hôs</i>) their earth-born <b><i>brothers</i></b> (<i>tês chôras adelphôn ontôn kai gêgenôn</i>).” (414e) Socrates [earth = the mother and nurse of the Athenians; other citizens = brothers]</p>
                        <p>Shorey (LCL <i>Republic</i> II 303n<i>e</i>) cites <i>Menexenus</i> 237e–238a as a parallel for this symbolism, but in that text, purporting to be a patriotic funeral oration, the earth-mother symbolism is stated as a fact without the adornment of simile or any rhetorical flourish.</p>
                        <p>11. “[The Guardians] must repel [attackers from outside], if <i>some enemy</i> (<i>polemios</i>) <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) a <b><i>wolf</i></b> (<i>lykos</i>) should come against the flock.” (415E) Socrates [outside attackers versus &gt; Athens = wolf versus &gt; a flock of sheep]</p>
                        <p>Cf. <i>Laws</i> Book 10.8 (906d) for the simile of wolves trying to bribe guard-dogs, cited as an image for the impossible theory that the gods could be bribed by criminals. Another example that brings these two creatures together is the paradoxical simile spoken by the Elean Visitor at <i>Sophist</i> 231a: a <i>wolf</i> <b>is very similar to</b> <b><i>a dog</i></b>, the <i>wildest</i> to the <b><i>mildest</i></b> [of animals]. See below, <i>Sophist</i> [3] (231a).</p>
                        <p>12. “It would be most shameful for shepherds to breed dogs … that through hunger or some other evil condition, shall attack the sheep … and <b>be likened to</b> <b><i>wolves</i></b> instead of <i>dogs</i> (<i>anti kynôn lykois homoiôthênai</i>).” (416a) Socrates [dogs = wolves]</p>
                        <p>The image of ‘a wolf in sheep’s clothing’ or the variant ‘foxes guarding the hen-house (or chicken coop)’ may be found in many contexts, from Jesus’ reference to false prophets “who come to you in sheep’s clothing” (Matthew 7:15) to modern political allusions (e.g. bankers regulating Wall Street).

                        <p>1. “Our first task then … is to <i>mould</i> (<i>plattomen</i>) [the model of] the happy (<i>tên eudaimona</i>) <i>state</i> … <b>as if</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) we were <b><i>colouring a statue</i></b> (<i>hêmâs andrianta graphontas</i>). (420c) Socrates [mould the state = colouring a statue]</p>
                        <p>2. “For surely such fellows are the most charming spectacle in the world <i>when they enact and amend such laws </i>as we just now described and are perpetually expecting to find a way of putting an end to frauds in business and in the other matters of which I was speaking because they can&#8217;t see that they are in very truth, <b>as it were</b>, [trying to] <b><i>cut off a Hydra&#8217;s </i>[<i>head</i>]</b> (<i>agnoûntes hoti tôi onti hôsper Hydran temnousin</i>).” (426a) Socrates [enacting and amending such laws = (<i>hôsper</i>) cutting off a Hydra’s head]</p>
                        <p>3. “If you wish, I can illustrate it [= what sort of things should be feared (429c)] by a <i>similitude</i> (<i>homoion eînai, ethelô apeikasai</i>). (429d) Socrates [moral training of the guardians = dying of selected white wools with fast colors] There follows the analogy of dyers of wool and how they hold the purple hue:</p>
                        <p>“We had no other purpose than that they [the guardians] should receive <i>our laws</i> <b>like</b> <b><i>dye</i></b> [<i>as it were</i>] (<i>tous nomous … hôsper baphên</i>) so that their belief and faith (<i>hê</i> <i>doxa</i>) might be fast-coloured (<i>deusopoios</i>) … (430a) Socrates [our laws = dye]</p>
                        <p>4a–b. “And so that their dye (<i>baphên</i>) might not be worked out by those dreadful lyes (<i>ta rhymata taûta</i>), <i>pleasure</i> (<i>hê te hêdonê</i>)—<b>more potent than</b> <b><i>any detergent</i></b> <b><i>or abstergent</i></b> (<i>chalestraiou deinotera oûsa … kai konias</i>)—<i>and pain and fear and desire</i> [<b>more sure] than</b> <b><i>any lye</i></b> (<i>pantos allou rhymmatos</i>).” (430a–b) Socrates [pleasure / pain / fear / desire = lyes (detergents)]</p>
                        <p>5. “Glaucon, it is time for <i>us</i>, <b>like</b> <b><i>hunters</i></b> (<i>hôsper kynêgetas</i>), to surround the covert and keep close watch so that justice may not slip through and vanish from our sight.” (432b) Socrates [us = hunters]</p>
                        <p>Shorey (365n<i>f</i>) comments that the “elaboration of the image here is partly to mark the importance of <i>dikaiosynê</i> and partly to relieve the monotony of continuous argument.”</p>
                        <p>6. “Why all the time … the thing was tumbling about our feet … and yet <i>we</i> could not see it, but were most ludicrous, <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>people who sometimes hunt for what they hold in their hands</i></b>. So we did not turn our eyes upon it, but looked off in the distance, which was perhaps the reason it escaped us.” (432d–e) Socrates [we = people who sometimes hunt for what they hold in their hands]</p>
                        <p>7. “It may be that by <i>examining them* </i>side by side (<i>par’ allêla skopoûntes</i>) and rubbing them (<i>tribontes</i>) against one another, <b>as it were</b>, <b><i>from the fire-sticks</i></b> (<i>hôsper ek pyreiôn</i>) we may cause the spark of justice to flash forth (<i>eklampsai poiêsaimen tên dikaiosynên</i>).” (435a) Socrates [examining them = rubbing with fire-sticks]</p>
                        <p>*Socrates compares justice in an individual with justice in a city: “Then a just man too will not differ at all (<i>ouden dioisei</i>) from a just city (<i>dikaios ara anêr dikaias poleôs</i>) in respect of the very form of justice (<i>kat’ auto to tês dikaiosynês eîdos</i>), but will be like it (<i>alla homoios estai</i>).” (435a–b)</p>
                        <p>8–9. “When a man believes himself to be wronged, does <i>his spirit</i> (<i>thymos</i>, 440b) not seethe and grow fierce … and will not let go until it either achieves its purpose or death ends it all, or <b>as</b> a <b><i>dog</i></b> <b><i>is called back by a shepherd</i></b> (<i>hôsper kyôn hypo nomeôs</i>), <i>it</i> is <i>called back by the reason</i> (<i>hypo tou logou</i>) within and calmed?” (440d) Socrates [spirit called back by reason = a dog called back by a shepherd] “Your <i>similitude</i> is perfect (<i>pany … eoike toutôi hô legeis</i>),” he [Glaucon] said, “and confirms our former statement that <i>the helpers</i> (<i>epikourous</i>) <b>are as it were<i> dogs</i></b> (<i>hôsper kynas</i>) subject to the <i>rulers</i> (<i>tôn archontôn</i>) who <b>are</b> <b>as it were</b> <b><i>the shepherds of the city</i></b> (<i>hôsper poimenôn poleos</i>).” Glaucon [helpers = dogs; rulers = shepherds of the city]</p>
                        <p>10. The truth, then, as it seems, is that justice is not concerned with the activity outside oneself, but about the interior (443d) … not permitting outside affairs to concern us … but in reality arranging one’s own affairs and ruling over oneself and keeping order and becoming a friend to oneself (<i>philon genomenon heautôi</i>) and harmonizing [the]<i> three parts</i> [(<i>xynarmosanta tria onta</i>) of the soul] <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) three <b><i>tones of harmony</i></b> (<i>orous treis harmonias atechnôs</i>) specifically the low, the high and the middle … and becoming a unit (<i>hena genomenon ek pollôn</i>). (443c–e) Socrates [three parts of the soul = three notes of harmony]</p>
                        <p>The three parts of the soul are identified (441e) as the rational (<i>to logistikon</i>), high-spirited (<i>to thymoeides</i>), and (442a) appetitive (<i>to epithymêtikon</i>). Note the phrase at the end (443e1, <i>hena ek pollôn</i>) that corresponds to the U.S.A. motto <i>e pluribus unum</i>.</p>
                        <p>11. “Therefore <i>it</i> [<i>autên</i> = <i>adikia </i>= <i>injustice</i>] <b>must be</b> (<i>deî eînai</i>) <b><i>a kind of civil war</i></b> (<i>stasin tina</i>) of these three [principles].” (444b) Socrates [injustice = a kind of civil war]</p>
                        <p>12. “<i>Virtue</i> (<i>aretê</i>), then, <b>would be</b> a <b><i>kind of health</i></b> (<i>hygieia tis aneiê</i>) and beauty (<i>kallos</i>) and good condition of the soul (<i>euexia psychês</i>), and <i>vice</i> (<i>kakia</i>) <b>would be</b> <b><i>disease</i></b> (<i>nosos</i>), ugliness (<i>aischos</i>) and weakness (<i>astheneia</i>).” (444d–e) Socrates [virtue = health; vice = disease]</p>

                        <p><b>Republic V</b> (449–480) Paul Shorey, LCL 1978 (1930) [Plato V]</p>
                        <p><i>Rule of the philosophers; guardians and Forms </i>(<i>idea</i>)<i>.</i></p>
                        <p>Metaphors abound at the beginning of this book: you are a slacker (<i>aporrhaithymeîn hêmîn dokeîs</i>, 449c) and are trying to cheat us out of a whole division … we have long been lying in wait for you (<i>perimenon</i>, 449d) … ‘set me down too,’ said Glaucon, ‘as voting this ticket (<i>eme … koinônon tês psêphou tautês tithete</i>, 450a)</p>
                        <p>… ‘Surely,’ said Thrasymachus, ‘you may consider it a joint resolution of us all, Socrates (<i>pâsi taûta dedogmena hêmîn nomize</i>),’ and Socrates’ reply (450a–b): ‘You don’t realize what a swarm of arguments you have stirred up by this demand (<i>ouk iste hoson esmon logôn epegeirete</i>).’ Then Thrasymachus replies, “Do you suppose this company has come here to prospect for gold (literally ‘to smelt ore’) and not listen to discussions (<i>chrysochoêsontas oiei tousde nûn enthade aphîchthai</i>, 450b)?” The introduction ends with a reference to finishing the male drama (<i>meta andreîon drâma</i>) before turning to the female (<i>to gynaikeîon aû perainein</i>, 451c), i.e. Socrates’ discussion of the communion of wives and children among the guardians and the rearing of children between birth and formal schooling. See above at <i>Meno</i> 1, where phrases like ‘swarm of arguments’ are considered similes.</p>
                        <p>1. “If any false note (<i>plêmmeles</i>) in the<i> argument</i> (<i>toû logou</i>) does us any harm, we release you <b>as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>in a homicide case</i></b> (<i>phonou</i>), and warrant you pure (<i>katharon</i>) of hand and no deceiver (<i>apateôna</i>) of us.” (451b) Glaucon to Socrates [the argument = a homicide case] Shorey (432n<i>a</i>) comments that <i>hôsper</i> here “marks the legal metaphor.”</p>
                        <p>With reference to the common training of males and females, Socrates brings up the analogy of watchdogs (<i>tôn phylakôn kynôn</i>, 451d) as guardians of the flock; Shorey’s note (433n<i>c</i>) lists other passages for the use of “analogies drawn from animals cf. 375–376, 422D, 466D, 467B, 491D–E, 537A, 546A–B, 564A.”</p>
                        <p>“Whether one tumbles into a little pool or into the great sea (<i>to megiston pelagos</i>), one must swim (<i>neî</i>) just the same. Therefore we, too, must swim (<i>neusteon … ek toû logou</i>) and try to save ourselves from the [<b><i>sea </i></b><i>of</i>] <i>argument</i> in the hope that either some dolphin will take us on its back or some other desperate rescue.” (453d) Socrates [argument = the sea] This is a metaphor <i>translated as a simile</i> by the addition of the word ‘sea’. Shorey (440n<i>a</i>) cites <i>Protagorus</i> 338a for the <i>pelagos tôn logôn</i> (sea of words).</p>
                        <p>2. They must strip to exercise “since they will be clothed with <i>virtue</i> <b>instead of</b> <b><i>cloaks</i></b> (<i>aretên anti imatiôn amphiesontai</i>).” (457a) Socrates [virtue = a cloak]</p>
                        <p>NB ‘anti’ as the prothesis here (preposition with the genitive case).</p>
                        <p>3. “The man who laughs at the idea of women stripped for exercise (<i>epi gymnais gynaixi</i>) is ‘plucking the unripe <b><i>fruit</i></b> <b>of</b> <i>laughter</i> (<i>atelê tou geloiou drepôn karpon</i>)’.” (457a) Socrates [laughter = unripe fruit] This is adapted from Pindar, fr. 209 Schroeder, according to Shorey, 457n<i>a</i>. Here the vehicle (fruit) is metaphorical (‘unripe’, perhaps because of ‘laughing too soon’).</p>
                        <p>4. “We may say that we have escaped <i>this one matter</i> [(<i>toûto hen</i>) the regulation of women] <b>like</b> <b><i>a wave</i></b> (<i>hôsper kûma</i>) so that we have not been completely overwhelmed (<i>kataklysthênai</i>) …” (Socrates) “You really are escaping no small wave (<i>ou smikron kûma</i>).” (457b–c) Glaucon [difficult topic = a wave]</p>
                        <p>5. “Permit <i>me</i> to take a holiday (<i>heortasai</i>, a metaphor) <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>idle people</i></b> (<i>hoi argoi</i>) are accustomed to dine on (<i>hestiâsthai</i>) their own thoughts (a metaphor) when they walk alone.” (458a) Socrates [me/Socrates = an idle person dining on his own thoughts]</p>
                        <p>Socrates’ language becomes metaphorical here as he prepares to meet the difficult arguments about the community of women and children in the new regime. In 457e he refers to the ‘coalition of arguments’ (<i>logôn sysstasin</i>) he must face; his intention of ‘running away’ (<i>apodrasesthai</i>) from one of the arguments with Glaucon indicating that he had not ‘escaped detection’ (<i>ouk elathes … apodidraskôn</i>); and the necessity of ‘paying a penalty’ (<i>hyphekteon dikên</i>). Thus the statement about taking a ‘holiday’ to work out his strategy on his own is put in this context.</p>
                        <p>6. A little further on (462c) Socrates suggests a similarity between a city and the individual: “What type [of city] is closest to a single person (<i>enggytata henos anthrôpou</i>)? When one of us hurts his finger, the whole organism suffers …” More specifically (at 464a–b) he says that the greatest blessing for a city was the holding of wives and children in common among the guardians and <b>compared</b> (<i>apeikazontes</i>) <i>a well-run city </i>(<i>eû oikoumenên polin</i>) to<b><i> a body</i></b> (<i>sômati</i>) in respect to its reaction to pain or pleasure in any part of it. Thus metaphors and similes are intertwined in Socrates’ discussion of the three waves that they must face in analyzing the ideal community.</p>
                        <p>[a well-run city = a body]</p>
                        <p>7. “Do you think that there is <b>any difference between</b> (<i>ti diaphoron drâin</i>)<i> people who do this</i> (<i>tous toûto poioûntas</i> [i.e. despoil a corpse]) and (= than) <b><i>dogs</i></b> (<i>tôn kynôn</i>) which bark at stones thrown at them but don’t attack the one who throws them?” “Not in the least, he said.” (469e) Socrates [people who despoil a corpse = dogs]</p>
                        <p>Aristotle (<i>Rhetoric</i> 1406b33–34) cites this passage as a simile, re-phrasing it (replacing ‘any difference between’) and adding the verb “are similar to” (<i>eoikasi</i>).</p>
                        <p>There is more metaphorical language in this passage (472–473) as Socrates says (472a) “You have made as it were a sudden assault (<i>hôsper katadromên</i>) on my theory without any regard for my natural hesitation (<i>stranggeuomenôi</i>). Perhaps you do not realize that when I have hardly escaped the first two waves (<i>ta dyô kymate</i>), you are now rolling up against me the ‘great third wave’ [of paradox], the worst of all.” The three waves are presented as (1) the same education for men and women, (2) the community of women and children, and (3) the philosopher-king. Then in support of his claim that such an ideal state might not exist, he gives the analogy of a painter (472), who portrays the pattern (<i>paradeigma</i>) of the ideally beautiful man but could not prove that he existed; would he then be any less good a painter?”</p>
                        <p>8. “I am on the verge of what we compared to (<i>proeikazomen</i>) the greatest <i>wave</i> (<i>chymati</i>) [of paradox], but it shall be said even if it is likely (<i>mellei</i>) to wash us away (<i>kataklysein</i>), <b>as it were</b>, by a <b><i>wave of laughter</i></b> <b><i>and scorn</i></b> (<i>gelôti te atechnôs hôsper kyma ekgelôn kai adoxiai</i>).” (473c) Socrates [laughter and scorn = a wave] Literally, the text would mean “wash us away by both laughter and scorn as it were just like a wave.” Thus the ‘wave’ would be the ‘difficult topic of paradox’ combined with laughter and scorn. Cf. <i>Republic</i><b> </b>5[4] (above).</p>
                        <p>There follows “perhaps the most famous sentence in Plato” (Shorey, 473n<i>a</i>,): “Unless either philosophers (<i>hoi philosophoi</i>) become kings (<i>basileusôsin</i>) in our states (<i>polesin</i>) or those whom we now call our kings and rulers take to the pursuit of philosophy seriously and adequately, there can be no cessation of troubles, dear Glaucon, in our cities nor, I fancy, for the human race either.” (473d) Socrates</p>
                        <p>9. “O Socrates, he [Glaucon] said, after throwing out such a bold statement as that (<i>rhêma te kai logon</i>) … (you must) expect that <i>many bold men</i> will, <b>as it were</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) cast off their clothes and take up the first weapons that come to hand and <b><i>rush at you in battle formation</i></b> intending to do amazing deeds.” (473e–474a) Glaucon [many bold men (Socrates’ opponents in debate) = soldiers in battle formation]</p>
                        <p>10–11. “<i>They</i> <b>are like</b> (<i>eoike</i>) <b><i>those </i></b>(<i>toîs</i>) [jesters] <b><i>who fool us</i></b> with double meanings (<i>epamphoterizousin</i>) at banquets and [resemble] <b><i>the children’s riddle</i></b> (<i>tôi paidiôn ainigmati</i>) about the eunuch (<i>toû eunouhou</i>) and his hitting of the bat (<i>tês bolês peri tês nykteridos</i>)<i> </i>…” (479b–c) Glaucon [they = [jesters] or children’s riddle]</p>
                        <p>“They” are the “many double things” (<i>ta polla diplasia</i>], e.g. the idea of beauty versus beautiful things (479b). See Shorey’s note (530–531n<i>c</i>) for one version of the riddle: “A tale there is, a man yet not a man, [eunuch] / Seeing, saw not, a bird and not a bird, [bat] / Perching upon a bough and not a bough, [reed] / And hit—not, with a stone and not a stone.

                        <p>1–2. “Do you think there is <b>any difference</b> (<i>diapherein</i>) between the <b><i>blind</i></b> (<i>typhlôn</i>) and <i>those who are truly deprived of knowledge</i> … who have no vivid pattern in their souls and so cannot, <b>as</b> <b><i>painters</i></b> (<i>hôsper grapheîs</i>) fix their eyes on the absolute truth? (484c) Socrates [<i>those who are truly deprived of knowledge</i> = the blind; ≠ painters]</p>
                        <p>3. [Such a man’s] <i>desires</i> (<i>hai epithymiai</i>) [which are strong in one direction] we know are weaker [in other directions] <b>like</b> <b><i>a stream</i></b> (<i>hôsper rheûma</i>) whose water has been turned aside.” (485d) Socrates [desires = a stream]</p>
                        <p>4. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) the <b><i>unskilled</i></b> (<i>hoi mê teleutôntes</i>) [<b><i>players</i></b>] are check-mated (<i>apokleiontai</i>) by experienced [chess] players (<i>petteuein deinôn</i>) and have no place to move, thus (<i>houtô</i>) also <i>these</i> [<i>inexperienced debaters</i> at forming questions and answers] are finally stopped and are <i>not able to say</i> anything when they are trapped not by [<i>chess men</i> (<i>psêphois</i>)] but by <i>words</i> (<i>logois</i>).” (487b–c) Adeimantus, who earlier (487a) had implicitly compared himself to Momos, the god of censure. [inexperienced debaters = unskilled game-board players] Of course the game here alluded to was not chess but the Greek game of <i>pesseia </i>(<i>petteia</i>). Shorey (14n<i>f</i>) cites other Platonic sources for this ‘figure’, including <i>Laws</i> 739a, 820c–d, 903d, <i>Hipparchus</i> 229e.</p>
                        <p>5. “You ask a question (<i>erôtêma</i>), I said, in need of an answer (<i>apokriseôs</i>) expressed <i>by image</i> (<i>di’ eikonos </i>[comparison, parable or simile]<i> legomenês</i>).” [Socrates] “ I suppose you are not accustomed to speak in similes (<i>di’ eikonôn</i>)” [Adeimantus]. “Well, I said—you are making fun of me after throwing me into such a difficult argument. Then hear my comparison (<i>eikonos</i>) so that you may see how eagerly I make comparisons (<i>hôs glischrôs eikazô</i>: “I strain after imagery” according to Shorey—see 17n<i>g</i>) … but the <i>person</i> <i>making a comparison</i> [or an allegory (<i>eikazonta</i>)] must collect it from many sources<i> </i>… <b>like</b> <b><i>painters</i></b> (<i>hoîon hoi grapheîs</i>) who combine goat-stags (<i>trag-elaphous</i>) and such [creatures]. Picture in your mind (<i>noêson</i>) … a shipmaster (<i>nauklêron</i>) in size and strength above all others in the ship but slightly deaf (<i>hypokôphon</i>) and blind (<i>horônta hôsautôs brachy ti</i>).” (487e–488a) Socrates [<i>eikôn</i>-makers = painters who combine animals]</p>
                        <p>There follows the famous allegory of the shipmaster (488b–e). The explicit simile here is that <i>allegorists</i> (or persons making comparisons) are <b>something</b> <b>like</b> (<i>hoion</i>) <b><i>painters</i></b>, and some answers (<i>apokrisis</i>)<i> </i>are best expressed as allegories or similes (<i>eikônes</i>). At 489a there is a suggestion that parables and similes (<i>tên eikona</i>) “should be examined (<i>exetazomenên tên eikona</i>) to determine (<i>idein</i>) if the terms of the comparison (<i>tên diathesin</i>) correspond to (<i>eoiken</i>) [the disposition of] the cities (<i>tais polesi</i>) towards the true philosophers (<i>pros tous alêthinous philosophous</i>).” “Then teach this parable (<i>didaske tên eikona</i>) to the man who is surprised (<i>ekeînon ton thaumazonta</i>) that philosophers are not honored in our cities (<i>hoti hoi philosophoi ou timôntai en taîs polisi</i>).” This passage illustrates the imprecise, or at least non-technical, meaning of <i>eikôn</i> (equivalent here to <i>allegory</i> or <i>parable</i>).</p>
                        <p>6. “Don’t you think the <i>real pilot</i> (<i>alêthôs kybernêtikon</i>) would actually be called (<i>kaleisthai</i>) <b><i>a star-gazer</i></b> (<i>meteôroskopon</i>) and <b><i>babbler</i></b> (<i>adoleschên</i>) and <b><i>simpleton</i></b> (<i>achrêston</i>) by the sailors in ships managed like this?” (488e–489a) Socrates [the real pilot = a star-gazer] In the next sentence Socrates calls this an <i>eikona</i> when he states, “I suppose that it is not necessary to put the comparison (simile, <i>eikona</i>) to the proof …”</p>
                        <p>7. “You would make no mistake in <b>likening</b> (<i>apeikazôn</i>) <i>our present political rulers</i> (<i>tous nûn politikôs archontas</i>) to the [sort of] <b><i>sailors</i></b> (<i>nautais</i>) we were just describing and those whom these call useless (<i>achrêstous</i>) star-gazing ideologists (<i>meteôroleschas</i>) to the true pilots (<i>hôs alêthôs kybernêtais</i>).” (489c) Socrates [present political rulers = bad sailors; useless star-gazing ideologists = true pilots]</p>
                        <p>8. “The <i>opinions </i>(<i>ta dogmata</i>) <i>of the many</i> (<i>hoi polloi</i>) which they dare … to call wisdom … <b>just as if</b> (<i>hoionper ei</i>) someone learned about (<i>emanthanen</i>) <b><i>the passions and desires</i></b> (<i>tas orgas kai epithymias</i>) of <b><i>a huge and mighty beast</i></b> (<i>thremmatos</i>) in his care.” (493a–b) Socrates [opinions of the many = passions of a huge beast]</p>
                        <p>9–10. “<i>Those</i> who thus fall away [from<i> philosophy</i>] … leaving it deserted and destitute … <b>like</b> <b><i>an orphan</i></b> (<i>hôsper orphanên</i>) without relatives … are <b>like</b><i> <b>men escaped from priso</b>n</i> (<i>hôsper hoi ek tôn eirgmôn</i>) who take sanctuary in temples.” (495c–d) Socrates [philosophy = an orphan; philosophic deserters = escaped prisoners seeking refuge in a temple]</p>
                        <p>11–12. “Do <i>they</i> [men poorly qualified for philosophy (<i>polloi ateleîs anaxioi paideuseôs</i>)] seem … to <b>differ</b> (<i>diapherein</i>) at all from a <b><i>little bald-headed copper smith who has made some money</i></b> (<i>chalkeôs</i>), who has just been freed (<i>lelumenou</i>) from his bonds and fresh from a bath (<i>leloumenou</i>), wearing a new cloak, <b>like</b> <b><i>a bride-groom</i></b> (<i>hôs nymphiou</i>) about to marry his master’s daughter because of his poverty and need?” (495e) Socrates [bad philosophers = a bald coppersmith = a newly-freed-slave bridegroom]</p>
                        <p>A remarkable punning description (<i>lelumenou</i> &#8216;freed&#8217; … <i>leloumenou </i>&#8216;washed&#8217;), with a simile within a simile: bad philosophers = ‘a little bald-headed tinker (Shorey’s phrase) = a bride-groom, etc. Shorey (50n<i>a</i>) cites <i>Lovers</i> 134b and <i>Euthyphro</i> 2b as parallels for this short vivid description. (See above under <i>Lovers </i>and <i>Euthyphro</i>.) Plato’s critical portrayal of people who have ‘fallen away’ from philosophy is notable. At 496b–c he refers to “the bridle (<i>ho chalinos</i>) of our companion Theages” which might operate as a restraint; “for in the case of Theages all other conditions were at hand for his backsliding from philosophy (<i>pros to ekpeseîn philosophias</i>), but his sickly habit of body (<i>hê tou sômatos nosotrophia</i>) keeping him out of politics holds him back.” This bridle has become proverbial: Plutarch <i>De san. tuenda</i> 126b, Aelian, <i>Varia Historia</i> 4.15. The<i> LCL</i> translation expresses this as a simile (345): “Theages, our comrade whose <i>delicate health</i> has restrained him from politics <b>like</b> <b><i>a bridle</i></b>.”</p>
                        <p>13–14. “[<i>Those who have tasted philosophy</i>] … seeing sufficiently the madness of the multitude (<i>tên manian tôn pollôn</i>), … [will perish] <b>like </b>(<i>hôsper</i>)<i> <b>a man who has fallen among wild beasts</b></i> (<i>eis thêria anthrôpos empesôn</i>) … [therefore the <i>philosopher</i>] keeps his silence minding his own business, <b>like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>)<i> <b>someone who stops under a wall</b></i> (<i>hypo teichion apostas</i>) in a storm of dust and sea-spray carried by the wind.” (496c–d) Socrates [philosopher = a man who has fallen among wild beasts = someone who stops under a wall for protection in a storm]</p>
                        <p>15. “No state today is worthy of the <i>philosophic nature</i> (<i>philosophou physeôs</i>)—which is the cause of its perversion and alteration, <b>as</b> a <b><i>foreign seed</i></b> sown in alien soil (<i>hôsper xenikon sperma en gêi allêi speiromenon</i>) is wont to die out into the native growth …” (497a) Socrates [philosophic nature = a foreign seed sown in alien soil]</p>
                        <p>16. “[As for] those who take up philosophy in their youth before they engage in business and money-making, towards old age with few exceptions <i>their </i>[<i>light</i>] is <i>quenched</i> (<i>aposbennyntai</i>) <b>more completely than</b> (<i>poly mâllon</i>) <b><i>the sun </i></b>(<i>hêliou</i>)<b><i> of Heracleitus</i></b>, inasmuch as it is never rekindled.” (498a) Socrates [their light [is quenched] = the sun of Heracleitus] This cluster of similes (9–16) dwells on poorly qualified and trained philosophers.</p>
                        <p>17. Near the end of Book Six the image of the divided line is presented as a simile: “Conceive (<i>noêson</i>) then … that there are these <i>two</i> [<i>entities</i>] … the visible (<i>horaton</i>) and the intelligible (<i>noêton</i>) … <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>)<i> </i>a <b><i>line </i></b>(<i>grammên</i>) <b><i>divided into two unequal parts</i></b>” (509d, <i>dicha tetmêmenên labôn anisa tmêmata</i>). (509d) Socrates [the visible (world of appearances) + the intelligible (the world perceived by the mind) = a divided line]</p>
                        <p>Here is the context: “Neither vision (<i>opsis</i>) nor its vehicle the eye (<i>omma</i>) is identical with the sun (<i>ouk estin hêlios</i>), although the eye is the most sun-like (<i>hêlioeidestaton</i>) of all the instruments of sense (<i>tôn peri tas aesthêseis organôn</i>)<i>.</i> An analogy: as the good is to reason, so the eye is to vision. (508a–c). Now apply this [comparison] to the soul (<i>houtô kai to tês psychês hôde noei</i>). (508d) But as for knowledge and truth (<i>epistêmên de kai alêtheian</i>), as in our [illustration] (<i>houtô kai entaûtha</i>), it is right to consider light and vision (<i>phôs te kai opsin</i>) sun-like (<i>hêlioeidê</i>), but never to think they are the sun (<i>hêlion de hêgeîsthai ouk orthôs echei</i>); so it is right to deem these two their counterparts as being like the good (<i>agathoeidê</i>) but to think that either is the good (<i>agathon</i>) is not right (<i>ouk orthon</i>)<i>.</i>” [Socrates] “An inconceivable beauty (<i>amêchanon kallos</i>) you speak of if it is the source of knowledge and truth, yet surpasses them in beauty (<i>kallei</i>). For you surely cannot mean that it is pleasure (<i>hêdonên</i>). (509a) [Glaucon] “Hush” (<i>euphêmei</i>), I [Socrates] said, “but examine (<i>episkopei</i> [509b]) <b>the similitude</b> (<i>tên <b>eikona</b></i>) of it (<i>autoû</i>) still further (<i>eti</i>) in this way.“ [Then Glaucon said:] “Don’t stop but at least expound <b>the similitude of the sun</b> (<i>tên peri ton hêlion <b>homoiotêta</b> aû diexiôn</i>) and don’t omit anything.” [509c: note the two words for ‘similitude’ (simile?): <i>tên <b>eikona</b></i> and <i>tên <b>homoiotêta</b></i>]. “One of them is sovereign over the intelligible order and region and the other over the world of the eye-ball (<i>to d’ aû <b>horatoû</b></i>), not to say the ‘sky-ball’ (<i>hina mê <b>ouranoû</b> eipôn doxô soi sophizesthai peri to onoma</i>), but let that pass. You surely apprehend the two types, <i>the visible and the intelligible</i>.” “I do.” (Glaucon) “Perceive <i>them</i> as two parts, one ruling over the noetic area (<i>genous</i>, i.e. perceived by the mind) and one over the visible (perceived by the eyes) … <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>a line</i></b> (<b><i>grammên</i></b>) divided into two (<b><i>dicha tetmêmenên</i></b>) unequal sections.” [509d] Socrates</p>
                        <p>According to J. Adam’s note, <a href="#n7" name="a7">[7]</a> “the simile of the line contains perhaps more Platonic teaching than any passage of equal length in Plato’s writings.”</p>

                        <p>1. “After this I said, ‘Imagine an allegory of (<i>apeikason tosoutôi pathei</i> [literally, &#8216;compare to such an experience&#8217;) our nature with regard to education and ignorance (<i>paideias ti peri kai apaideusias</i>). Now picture (<i>ide</i>) <i>humans</i> <b>as</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>in an underground cave-like dwelling</i></b> (<i>en katageiôi oikêsei spêlaiôdei</i>).’” (514a) Socrates [humans = (people living) in a cave] The allegory of the cave depicts and helps to explain the different levels of understanding described in the simile of the line, where the cave and fire represent the world of appearances visible to the eye, and the eternal, unchanging realm outside the cave represents the intelligible world perceived only by the mind.</p>
                        <p>2. “Picture (<i>ide,</i> repeated at 514b) <i>a low wall</i> (<i>teichion</i>) built <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>for puppet shows</i></b> (<i>toîs thaumatopoioîs</i>) where the partition (<i>ta paraphragmata</i>) lies before the men above which they show the puppets (<i>ta thaumata</i>).” (514b) Socrates [a low wall in the cave = the wall in puppet shows]</p>
                        <p>“&#8217;A strange (<i>atopon</i>) image (<i>eikona</i>) you speak of,’ he said, ‘and strange prisoners (<i>desmôtas atopous</i>).’ (515a) Glaucon ‘Like us (<i>homoious hêmîn</i>)’, I said.”</p>
                        <p>3–4. “This image (<i>eikona</i>) then, dear Glaucon, we must apply to all that has been said, <b>likening</b> (<i>aphomoioûnta</i>) <i>the region revealed through sight</i> to <b><i>the habitation </i></b>(<i>oikêsei</i>)<b><i> of the prison</i></b> and <i>the light of the fire</i> in it to <b><i>the power </i></b>(<b><i>dynamei</i></b>)<b><i> of the sun</i></b>.” (517a–b) Socrates [the region revealed through sight = the prison; the light of the fire in it = the power of the sun] He adds (517d2) that “it is likely (<i>eikos</i>) [that those who have attained this height may not willing to concern themselves with the concerns of men] if in this point too <b>the likeness</b> of our image holds (<i>tên proeirêmenên <b>eikona</b> toût’ echei</i>).”</p>
                        <p>5. “Education (<i>paideian</i>) is not what some proclaim it to be … that they can <i>put knowledge </i>(<i>epistêmê</i>) <i>into a soul</i> that does not possess it <b>as if</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>inserting vision into blind eyes</i></b> (<i>typhloîs ophthalmoîs opsin epithentes</i>).” (518b) Socrates [putting education in a soul ≠ inserting vision into blind eyes] Cf. Socrates’ similar observation in <i>Symposium</i> 1: “How fine it would be, Agathon, (he said) if <i>wisdom</i> (<i>sophia</i>) could flow from the fuller to the emptier of us … <b>like</b> <b><i>water</i></b> (<i>hôsper hydôr</i>) in cups flowing through wool from the fuller cup to the emptier one …” (175d)</p>
                        <p>6. “Our argument (<i>logos</i>) indicates that the indwelling power (<i>dynamin</i>) in the soul and the instrument (<i>organon</i>) <i>by which each person learns</i> (<i>katamanthanei</i>) is <b>just as if </b>(<i>hoîon e</i>i) <b><i>the eye </i></b>(<i>omma</i>)<b><i> could not turn toward the light from the darkness except by turning the whole body</i></b> …” (518c) Socrates [education = turning the eye of the soul]</p>
                        <p>Note that these two similes (5–6) illustrate the argument that education is not inserting something but rather adjusting the eye of the soul. Shorey’s translation of 518c: “this organ of knowledge must be turned around from the world of becoming together with the entire soul, like the scene-shifting periact in the theatre.” (134n<i>c</i>: “probably a reference to the <i>periacta</i> or triangula prisms on each side of the stage.”)</p>
                        <p>7. “If this part of such a nature from childhood had been hammered and struck free (<i>koptomenon periekopê</i>) of the <b><i>leaden weights</i></b>, so to speak (<i>hôsper molybdidas</i>), of our birth<i> … food and similar pleasure</i> … it would have turned towards the true things (<i>eis ta alêthê</i>).” (519a–b) Socrates [food and pleasure = leaden weights of the soul]</p>
                        <p>8. “We have engendered <i>you</i> (philosophers) for yourselves and the rest of the <i>city</i> (<i>polei</i>) to be, <i>as it were</i>, <b><i>king-bees</i></b> and leaders (<i>hêgemonas te kai basileas</i>) in the <b><i>hive</i></b> (<i>hôsper en</i> <i>smênesin</i>).” (520b) Socrates [you &gt; the city = king-bees &gt; a bee-hive]</p>
                        <p>9. “Would you like for us to consider how <i>such men</i> [i.e. guardians / philosophers] may be produced in a state and how they may be <i>led upward to the light</i> even <b>as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>some are fabled to have ascended from Hades to the gods</i></b> (<i>ex Haidou eis theous</i>)?” (521c) Socrates [men led to light = some from Hades became gods] Shorey (146n<i>b</i>) cites Amphiaraus (Pausanias i. 34) as a possible example of such ‘fabled’ men.</p>
                        <p>10–11. “<i>This</i> [<i>education</i>] <b>would not be</b> (<i>ouk an eiê</i>) the <b><i>whirling of the shell</i></b> (<i>ostrakou peristrophê</i>) [in the children’s game], <b>but</b> a <b><i>conversion of the soul</i></b> (<i>psychês periagôgê</i>) from night to day … to true philosophy (<i>philosophian alêthê</i>).” (521c) Socrates [true education ≠ whirling of the shell = a conversion of the soul]</p>
                        <p>What study (<i>mathêma</i>) has the power (<i>dynamin</i>) to draw the soul away from the world of becoming to the world of being (<i>psychês holkon apo toû gignomenou epi to on, </i>521c–d)?</p>
                        <p>12. “We must use the blazonry (<i>poikiliai</i>) of the <i>heavens as patterns</i> (<i>paradeigmasi</i>) to aid in the study of those realities, <b>just as</b> (<i>homoiôs hôsper</i>) one would do who chanced upon <b><i>diagrams </i></b>(<i>diagrammasi</i>)<b><i> drawn by Daedalus</i></b> or some other craftsman or painter (<i>dêmiourgoû ê grapheôs</i>).” (529d–e) Socrates [patterns of heavens = diagrams of Daedalus]</p>
                        <p>13. <i>“</i>They<i> lay their ears alongside</i> (<i>paraballontes ta ôta</i>) [their instruments], <b>as if</b> <b><i>trying to hear what their neighbors are saying </i></b>(<i>hoîon ek geitonôn phônên thêreuomenoi</i>).” (531a) Socrates [listening = trying to hear the neighbors]</p>
                        <p>“You are speaking about those good people who trouble and torture their strings, stretching them on pegs; but lest our comparison/simile (<i>hê eikôn</i>) become too long—of blows with the plectrum and accusations and denials and boasting of strings—I am dropping the figure (<i>pauomai tês eikonos</i>, 531b).” Socrates (The implied comparison between torturing slaves and tuning a lyre is expressed metaphorically and not explicitly in the Greek: “Those worthies (<i>tous chrêtous </i>[ironic]) who vex and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs” (<i>tous taîs chordaîs pragmata parechontas kai basanizontas, epi tôn kollopôn strebloûntas</i>, 531b). He continues the musical theme at 532d–e: “Let us assume that these things are as now has been said and proceed to the <b>melody</b> itself (<i>ton nomon</i>) and go through it as we have gone through the <b>prelude</b> (<i>houtôs hôsper to prooimion diêlthomen</i>). Cf. 533a: “If I could, I would show you no longer an image or symbol (<i>eikona</i>), as it appears to me, of my meaning, but the very truth (<i>auto to alêthes</i>).”</p>
                        <p>14. “Does it then seem to you, I said, that for us <i>dialectic</i> lies <b>like </b>a <b><i>coping stone</i></b> for our subjects of education (<i>he dialektikê hôsper thri</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>gkos tois mathêmasin</i>)?” (534e) Socrates [dialectic = the copingstone of education]</p>
                        <p>15. “We shall regard as <i>maimed </i>(<i>anapêron</i>)<i> the soul</i> that hates the voluntary lie (<i>hekousion pseûdos</i>) … and is not distressed when convicted of lack of knowledge but wallows in [the mud of] ignorance (<i>en amathiai</i>) [as] insensitively (<i>hôsper eucherôs</i>) <b>as</b> a <b><i>pig</i></b> (<i>hôsper thêrion hyeion</i>, literally: a swinish beast).” (535e) Socrates [the maimed soul = a pig]</p>

                        <p>At 574d his newly released opinions are called bodyguards (<i>doryphoroûsai</i>) of his ruling passion.</p>
                        <p>2. “The <i>tyrant</i> (<i>ho tyrannos</i>) is the only one who cannot travel abroad to sacred festivals like other citizens, but must live for the most part cowering (<i>katadedukôs</i>) in his house <b>like</b> [<i>hôs</i>] <b><i>a woman</i></b> (<i>gynê</i>).” (579b) Socrates [the tyrant <i>= </i>a woman]</p>

                        <p>1. “Do not [<i>the words of poets</i> (<i>ta tôn poiêtôn</i>)] <b>resemble</b> (<i>eoike</i>) <b><i>the faces of young men</i></b> (<i>toîs tôn hôraiôn prosôpois</i>), handsome but not really beautiful, when the bloom [of youth] abandons them?” (601b) Socrates [the words of poets = the faces of young men]</p>
                        <p>2. “Our grieving checks the thing we need to come to our aid as soon as possible.” What thing?” “<i>To deliberate </i>(<i>tôi bouleuesthai</i>)<i> </i>about what has happened, and, <b>as it were</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) in <b><i>the fall of dice </i></b>(<i>en ptôsei kybôn</i>)<i> to determine the movements of our affair</i> with reference to the number that turns up (<i>pros ta peptôkota</i>) according to reason would be best …” (604c) Socrates [deliberation = checking the number on the dice]</p>
                        <p>3. … instead of <b><i>stumbling</i></b> <b>like</b> <b><i>children</i></b> (<i>kathaper paîdas</i>), clapping one’s hands to the stricken spot and wasting time in <i>wailing</i> … ever to accustom the soul to devote itself at once to the curing of the hurt, ‘banishing threnody by therapy’ (Shorey’s alliterative translation of <i>iatrikêi thrênôidian aphanizonta</i>)” (604c) Socrates [we in grief (from [2] above) = children stumbling]</p>
                        <p>4. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>men who have fallen in love</i></b> (<i>hoi pote tou erasthentes</i>), if they think the love is not good for them … nevertheless refrain (<i>apechontai</i>) … <b>so</b> we (<i>kai hêmeîs houtôs</i>) owing to the love of this kind of poetry (<i>dia ton enggegonota men erôta tês toiautês poiêseôs</i>) inbred in us by our education … <i>we shall chant this counter-charm to her spell</i> (<i>tautên tên epôidên</i>).” (607e) Socrates [we will chant a counter-charm = men who have fallen in love will refrain] Thus Socrates continues to justify his rejection of poetry from the city as the right thing to do (607b), compelled by the argument (<i>ho logos</i>) in “the ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry” (<i>palaia men tis diaphora philosophiai te kai poiêtikêi</i>, 607b5–6).</p>
                        <p>5. “For practically everything there is<i> its congenital evil</i> <i>and disease</i> (<i>schedon pâsi symphyton hekastôi kakon te kai nosêma</i>) … <b>as</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>for the eyes</i></b> (<i>ophthalmois</i>) <b><i>ophthalmia</i></b> and <b><i>for the body</i></b> (<i>sômati</i>) <b>disease</b> (<i>noson</i>).” (609a) Socrates [for everything an evil: <i>ophthalmia</i> &gt; the eyes = disease &gt; the body]</p>
                        <p>6. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) the <i>vice </i>(<i>ponêria</i>) <i>of the body</i> <b>being</b> (<i>oûsa</i> ‘like’) <b><i>sickness</i></b> (<i>nosos</i>) weakens and destroys (<i>diollusi</i>) it so that it is no longer a body at all, in like manner (<i>kai</i>) in all the examples we cited it was the native evil (<i>tês oikeias kakias</i>) that <span style="line-height: 1.5em">… reduces it to nothing.” (609c) Socrates [vice of the body</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em"> = </i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">sickness]</span></p>
                        <p>Much earlier (<i>Republic</i> 470c) Socrates had said metaphorically that <i>Greece was sick</i> when it was (literally “and”) divided by factions (<i>nosein … tên Hellada kai stasiazein</i>).</p>
                        <p>7. “Let us propose that <i>it </i>[<i>the soul’s condition</i>] <b>resembles</b> (<i>diakeimenon</i>) that of <b><i>the sea-god Glaucus</i></b> (<i>hôsper hoi ton thalattion Glaûkon horôntes</i>) [literally: ‘it is disposed as those seeing Glaukus of the sea’]: you could not easily see his original nature because the original limbs of his body are broken off and mutilated … by the waves and other things have attached themselves to him, shells and sea-weed and rocks, so that he appears like (<i>eoikenai hoîos</i>) every other wild creature than what he was by nature. This is our vision of the soul marred by countless evils. But we must look elsewhere, Glaucon.” (611d) Socrates [the soul = the sea-god Glaucus] Perhaps a humorous allusion to the sea-god whose name so closely resembles that of Plato’s brother.</p>
                        <p>8. “Do not your <i>smart but wicked men</i> <b>do</b> <b>the very thing which</b> (<i>hoper</i>) those<b><i> racers </i></b>do (<i>hoi</i> <i>dromês</i>) who run well ‘from the down’ [at the start] but not ‘from the up’ [back] … But the true runners come to the goal and receive the prizes and are crowned.” (613b–c) Socrates [smart but wicked men = poor racers]</p>
                        <p>(The next few similes come from the myth of Er (that starts at 614b): his return from death and his vision of the life beyond the grave.)</p>
                        <p>9–10. “They discerned (<i>kathorân</i>) … a <i>straight</i> <i>light</i> (<i>phôs euthy</i>) <b>like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) a <b><i>pillar</i></b> (<i>kiona</i>) <b>most nearly resembling</b> <b><i>the rainbow</i></b> (<i>malista têi iridi prospherê</i>) but brighter (<i>lamproteran</i>) and purer (<i>katharôteran</i>). (616b) Socrates [a light = a pillar; light = the rainbow]</p>
                        <p>11–12. Then they saw at the middle of the light the extremities of its fastenings stretched from heaven; for <i>this light</i> (<i>toûto to phôs</i>) <b>was</b> (<i>eînai</i>) the <b><i>girdle of the heavens</i></b> (<i>syndesmon toû ouranoû</i>) <b>like</b> the <b><i>undergirders of triremes</i></b> (<i>hoîon ta hypozômata tôn triêrôn</i>).” (616c) Socrates [this light = the girdle of the heavens = the undergirders of triremes]</p>
                        <p>13. “And from the extremities (<i>ek tôn akrôn</i>) was stretched (<i>tetamenon</i>) the spindle of Necessity ([<i>ho sphondulos</i>]<i> Anangkês atrakton</i>), through which all the orbits (<i>periphoras</i>) turned. (616c) And the nature (<i>tên physin</i>) of the whorl (<i>toû sphondylou</i>) was this (<i>toiande</i>): its shape (<i>to schêma</i>) was that of our world (hoiaper hê toû enthade) but we must conceive it to be as if (<i>hôsper</i>) in one great whorl, hollow and scooped out, there lay enclosed another like it but smaller, fitting into it <b>like</b> <b><i>boxes</i></b> (<i>kathaper hoi kadoi</i>) that fit into one another (<i>hoi eis allêla harmottontes</i>), <i>eight whorls</i> (<i>sphondylous</i>) in all.” (616d) Socrates [eight whorls = boxes]</p>
                        <p>14. “When all the <i>souls</i> (<i>pasas tas psychas</i>) had chosen their lives (<i>bious</i>) in the order of their lots (<i>hôsper elachon, </i>620d), … then suddenly they were carried up one after the other (in different directions) to their birth darting <b>like</b> <b><i>stars</i></b> (<i>hôsper asteras</i>).” (621b) Socrates reporting Er’s vision [souls = stars]</p>
                        <p>15. “But if we are persuaded by me, considering the soul immortal … we shall practice justice along with wisdom in every way, in order to become friends both with ourselves and with the gods (621a) … and when <i>we</i> receive our rewards (<i>ta athla</i>) <b>like</b> <b><i>victors</i></b> in the games (<i>hôsper hoi nikêphoroi</i>) collecting their [prizes] … we shall prosper (<i>eû prattômen</i>).<i>” </i>(621d) Socrates [we = athletic victors] Near the end of the <i>Apology</i> (36d) Socrates suggests a similar comparison with Olympic victors, who are given meals in the prytaneum. He deserves that prize more than such a winner in a horse race because “he makes you seem happy, whereas I make you happy in reality (<i>hymâs poieî eudamonas dokeîn, egô de eînai</i>).”</p>

                        <p>N.B. the reference (228c) to aiming at something and missing the mark as an illustration of ‘disproportion’ but as Fowler’s note says (309) “the connexion between disproportion and missing the mark in not obvious.”</p>
                        <p>2. “<b>Just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>physicians</i></b> (<i>hoi peri ta sômata iatroi</i>) … believe the body cannot benefit from food until all obstructions (<i>ta empodizonta</i>) are removed, [so] <i>those concerned with the soul</i> (<i>kai peri psychês … ekeinoi</i>) have come to the same conclusion … by removing the opinions (<i>doxas</i>) that obstruct (<i>empodious</i>) the teachings (<i>tois mathêmasin</i>) …” For all these reasons … we must assert that cross-questioning (<i>ton elengchon</i>) is the greatest … of all purifications (<i>tôn katharseôn</i>).” (230c–d) The Eleatic Visitor [those concerned with the soul = physicians of the body]</p>
                        <p>3. “A <i>wolf</i> (<i>lukos</i>) <b>is very similar to </b>(<i>proseoike</i>) <b><i>a dog</i></b> (<i>kyni</i>), the <i>wildest</i> to the <b><i>mildest</i></b> [of animals]. But the cautious man must be especially on his guard in the matter of resemblances (<i>tas homoiotêtas</i>), for they are very slippery things (<i>olisthêrotaton to genos</i>).” (231a) The Eleatic Visitor [a wolf (<i>wildest</i>) = a dog (<i>mildest</i>)] See references to dogs and wolves in Appendix II-J.</p>
                        <p>4. “Stopping (<i>stantes</i>) as it were (<i>hoîon</i>) let us catch our breath (<i>exapneusômen</i>). Let us count up the number of forms (<i>dialogisômetha</i>) in which the sophist has appeared to us (231c–d).” In his summary of this part of the Dialogue (231d) the Eleatic Visitor uses a series of predicate similes to define the Sophist. <i>He</i> <b>was found to be</b> (<i>hêurethê</i>): (1st) <b><i>a paid hunter</i></b> (<i>emmisthos</i> <i>thêreutês</i>) after the young (<i>neôn</i>) and wealthy (<i>plousiôn</i>); (2nd) <b><i>a kind of merchant</i></b> (<i>emporos tis</i>) in articles of knowledge in the soul (<i>ta tês psychês mathêmata</i>); (3rd)<b><i> a retailer</i></b> (<i>kapêlos</i>) of these articles of knowledge; (4<sup>th</sup>) <b><i>a seller</i></b> (<i>autopôlês</i>) of his own productions of knowledge; (added by Theaetetus) (5th) <b><i>an athlete</i></b> (<i>athlêtês</i>) in contests of words (<i>tês agônistikês peri logous</i>); (6th) <b><i>a purger of souls</i></b> (<i>peri psychên</i> <i>kathartên</i>), who removes opinions (<i>doxôn</i>) that obstruct (<i>empodiôn</i>) learning (<i>mathêmasi—231e</i>). [the sophist = paid hunter, merchant, retailer, seller, athlete, purger of souls]</p>
                        <p>5. “Is this now clear that <i>he </i>(<i>the sophist</i>) <b>is</b> (<i>esti</i>) <b><i>a kind of juggler</i></b> (<i>tôn goêtôn </i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">… </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">tis</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">), </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em"><i>an imitator of realities</i></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> (</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">mimêtês ôn tôn ontôn</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">)?

                        <p>6–7. “There truly <b>seems to be</b> (<i>eoike ge</i>) among them [the sophists] <b><i>some sort of </i></b>(<i>hoîon</i>)<b> <i>Battle of the Giants</i></b> (<i>gigantomachia tis</i>) on account of their <i>dispute</i> (<i>tên amphisbêtêsin</i>) about existence (<i>peri tês ousias</i>)… Some of them drag down to earth everything from heaven and the invisible, picking up <b><i>rocks and trees</i></b> (<i>petras kai drûs</i>), <b>as it were</b> (<i>atechnôs</i>) [= <i>arguments</i>] with their hands.” (246a–b) The Eleatic Visitor [sophists’ dispute = Battle of the Giants; arguments (<i>en tois logois</i>, 246c) = rocks and trees]</p>
                        <p>8. “Whence (<i>Hothen</i>) [referring to our <i>discussion </i>(<i>ton logon</i>),<i> </i>251a] I think we have provided (<i>pareskeuakamen</i>) <b><i>a feast</i></b> (<i>thoinên</i>) for the young and the late-learners among the old.” (251b) The Eleatic Visitor [discussion (<i>logos</i>) = a feast]</p>
                        <p>9. “But as the saying goes (<i>to legomenon</i>), having an enemy and future opponent at home, <i>they carry it</i> [the argument about existence] around with them always wherever they go, speaking from within (<i>entos hypophthenggomenon</i>) <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>the amazing Eurycles</i></b> (<i>ton atopon Euryklea</i>) [a ventriloquist of the fifth century BC].” (252c) The Eleatic Visitor “That is a remarkably accurate illustration (or ‘simile’, <i>komidêi legeis homoion te kai alêthes</i>),” Theaetetus adds. [philosophers who refute themselves = the ventriloquist Eurycles]</p>
                        <p>10. “Inasmuch as some things are willing to do this [mingle with one another], and some won’t, <i>they</i> would almost be <b>like</b> <b><i>letters</i></b> (<i>hoîon ta grammata</i>)<i> </i>[of the alphabet]. For some of these do not fit with each other, but others do.” (253a) The Eleatic Visitor [things that sometimes combine with other things = letters of the alphabet]</p>
                        <p>11. “The <i>vowels</i>, unlike the other [letters], move through them all <b>like</b> <b><i>a chain</i></b> (<i>hoion desmos</i> (253a) The Eleatic Visitor [vowels = a chain (in words that holds them together)]</p>
                        <p>12. “Shall we not say that we make a house by the art of building (<i>oikodomikê</i>), and by the art of painting (<i>graphikê</i>) make <i>another</i> [<i>house</i>, <i>oikian</i>], <b>a sort of</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>man-made</i></b> <b><i>dream</i></b> (<i>onar anthrôpinon</i>) produced for those who are awake (<i>egrêgorosin</i>)?” (266c) The Eleatic Visitor [a house by the art of painting (<i>graphikê</i>) = a man-made dream]</p>
                        <p>13. “Let us examine the <i>opinion-imitator</i> (<i>ton doxomimêtên</i>) <b>like</b> a <b><i>piece of iron </i></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em">(</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">hôsper sidêron</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">).” (267d–e) The Eleatic Visitor [the opinion-imitator = a piece of iron]</span></p>
                        <p>The sophist was classed among those who imitate—hence the scrutiny. N.B. Fowler’s suggestion in his Introduction (261) that the tedium of the “process of dichotomy” in this Dialogue “may possibly be one of Plato’s reasons for making the Stranger, not Socrates, the chief speaker in these two dialogues” [i.e. the Statesman also].</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><b>Statesman </b>(<b>or Politician</b>) (St II.257a–311c )  = H. N. Fowler 1975 (1924) [Plato VIII]</p>
                        <p><i>What is a statesman?</i><i></i></p>
                        <p>In form a continuation of <i>The Sophist</i>; as in that Dialogue the dramatic form is hardly more than a convention (Fowler’s Introduction, 2).</p>
                        <p>1–2. “But we shall find that <i>the statesman</i> (<i>politikon</i>) is <b>not</b> a keeper of a single animal, <b>like</b> some <b><i>ox-driver</i></b><i> </i>(<i>hôsper boêlatên</i>)<i> </i>or <b><i>horse groom</i></b> (<i>hippokomon</i>), but more <b>similar to</b> (<i>mâllon proseoikota</i>) a <b><i>horse-</i></b> or <b><i>cattle-herder</i></b> (<i>hippophorbôi, bouphorbôi</i>)” (261d) The Visitor [statesman ≠ an ox-driver = a horse- or cattle-herder]</p>
                        <p>3. “I say that [we] should consider <i>the statesmanlike and royal man</i> <b>like</b> <b><i>a charioteer</i></b> (<i>hoîon hêniochon</i>) … (and) hand over the reins of the city to him.” (266e) The Visitor [statesman = a charioteer]</p>
                        <p>4. “You have cleared up the <i>argument</i> finely and <b>just</b> <b>as if</b> it were <b><i>a debt</i></b> you were paying (<i>kathaperei chrea apedôkas</i>) you threw in the <i>digression</i> (<i>ektropên</i>) <b>as</b> <b><i>interes</i></b>t (<i>hoîon tokon</i>).” (267a) Young Socrates [argument &gt; digression = debt &gt; interest]</p>
                        <p>5. “The <i>herdsman</i> (<i>bouphorbos</i>) himself [is] the <b><i>caretaker</i></b> of the herd (<i>tês agelês trophos</i>), he himself is its <b><i>doctor</i></b> (<i>iatros</i>), he himself is <b>like</b> its <b><i>matchmaker</i></b> (<i>hoîon numpheutês</i>)…” (268a–b) The Visitor [herdsman = caretaker = doctor = matchmaker of the herd]</p>
                        <p>6. “Please pay careful attention, just <b>as if</b> <i>you</i> were a <b><i>child</i></b> (<i>kathaper hoi paîdes</i> &#8216;like children&#8217;), and anyway you are not much too old for children’s tales.” (<b><i>P</i></b><i>anu <b>p</b>roseche ton noûn katha<b>p</b>er hoi <b>p</b>aîdes: <b>p</b>antôs ou <b>p</b>olla ek<b>p</b>heugeis <b>p</b>aidias etê</i>.) Again we may note Plato’s use of alliteration for comic effect. (268e) The Visitor [you = a child]</p>
                        <p>7. “<b>Just as</b> <b><i>statue-makers</i></b> (<i>kathaper andriantopoioi</i>) who sometimes in their misapplied enthusiasm make too numerous … additions and thus delay the completion of their works, <i>we</i> too (<i>kai nûn hêmeîs</i>) … have taken up a marvelous mass of myth and <span style="line-height: 1.5em">… [have used] a greater part than we should.” (277a–b) The Visitor [we = statue-makers]</span></p>
                        <p>8. “<i>Our talk,</i> <b>just like</b> a <b><i>picture of a living creature</i></b> (<i>atechnôs hôsper zôi</i>), seems to have a good enough outline, but not yet the clearness that comes from pigments and blending of colours.” (277c) The Visitor [our talk = a picture of a living creature]</p>
                        <p>9. (a) “It would seem that <i>each of us knows everything</i> he knows <b>as if <i>in a dream</i></b> (<i>hoîon onar eidôs</i>) and then (b) when he is <b>as it were</b> <b><i>awake</i></b> (<i>hôsper hypar</i>), <i>knows nothing</i> at all.” (277d) The Visitor [we know everything = in a dream; we know nothing = awake]</p>
                        <p>10. “Let us divide [<i>the arts concerned with the state</i> (287b)], <b>like</b> <b><i>an animal that is sacrificed</i></b> (<i>hoîon hiereion</i>), by joints (<i>kata melê</i>) since we cannot bisect them.” (287c) The Visitor [the arts concerned with the state = a sacrificial animal]</p>
                        <p>11. “It [<i>a receptacle</i>, <i>anggeîon</i>] is <b>not like</b> a <b><i>tool</i></b> (<i>kathaper</i> <i>organon</i>) made for the purpose of production but exists for the preservation of that which has been produced.” (287e) The Visitor [a receptacle ≠ a tool]</p>
                        <p>12. “They are a mixed race (<i>pamphylon</i>) … <i>many of them</i> (<i>polloi</i>) <b>are like</b> (<i>eikasi</i>)<i> <b>lions</b></i> (<i>leousi</i>) and centaurs and other fierce creatures and <i>very many</i> (<i>pampolloi</i>) <b>are like</b> (<i>eikasi</i>) <b><i>satyr</i>s</b> (<i>satypois</i>) … (291a–b) The Visitor [many of them = lions; very many = satyrs]</p>
                        <p>13. “We see that <i>law</i> (<i>nomon</i>) aims at this very thing, <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) a <b><i>stubborn and ignorant man</i></b> (<i>anthrôpon</i>) who allows no one to do anything contrary to his command … not even to ask a question, not even if something new and better occurs to someone …” (294e) The Visitor [law = a stubborn and ignorant man]</p>
                        <p>14. “<b>Just as</b> <b><i>the captain of a ship</i></b> (<i>hôsper ho kybernêtês</i>) keeps watch for what is good for the vessel and sailor not by writing rules but by making his science his law (<i>tên technên nomon</i>), so (<i>houtô</i>) may not <i>right government</i> be established in the same way … making science (<i>technê</i>) more powerful than the laws?” (296e–297a) The Visitor [right government = the captain of a ship]</p>
                        <p>This simile is referred to later (297e) as images (<i>eikonas</i>) of the noble captain of a ship and the physician to portray kingly rulers: “Let us make a simile (<i>schêma</i>) and use it to help us discover “something of this sort” (298a: <i>toionde hoîon ei</i>): “Imagine that we all thought in regard to captains and physicians ‘we are most abominably treated by them.’ Then a long discussion (298–301) of what would happen if there were bad laws and rulers, alluding at one point to the trial of Socrates (299b–c). This <i>schêma</i> is perhaps better called a long analogy than a simile, although a simile is placed at the end of this long discussion (#15):</p>
                        <p>15. “There is not … <i>in our</i> <i>cities </i>(<i>polesi</i>) a <i>king</i> (<i>basileus</i>) <b>such as</b> (<i>hoîos</i>) is born <b><i>in bee-hives</i></b> (<i>en smênesin emphyetai</i>).” (301e) The Visitor [king in our cities ≠ in bee-hives]</p>
                        <p>16. “<i>Many </i>[<i>cities</i>] in fact sometimes also <b>exactly like </b>(<i>kathaper</i>) <b><i>ships</i></b> sinking perish [because of the worthlessness of their captains and sailors].” (302a) The Visitor [many cities = ships]</p>
                        <p>17. “The <i>seventh </i>[<i>form of government</i>] must be set apart from the others, <b>just as</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>God</i></b><i> </i>(<i>theon</i>) is set apart from man (<i>ex anthrôpôn</i>).” (303b) The Visitor [The seventh form of government<i> = </i>[G]od]</p>
                        <p>The seventh form refers to right government (monarchy with laws), the best form after monarchy.</p>
                        <p>18. “<i>This part</i> has been <b>exactly like</b> <b><i>a play</i></b> (<i>atechnôs hêmîn hôsper drâma</i>)… As we said (<i>kathaper errhêthê</i>) … a festive troop of centaurs and satyrs was coming into view (291a).” (303c) The Visitor [This part = a play]</p>
                        <p>19. “I think <i>we</i> (<i>moi phainometha</i>) are <b>in somewhat the same position as</b> <b><i>refiners of gold</i></b> (<i>toîs chryson kathairousi pathos homoîon peponthenai</i>).” (303e) The Visitor [we = refiners of gold]</p>
                        <p>20. “[The true and natural <i>Statesman’s art</i>] itself giving orders and supervising, <b>just as</b> (<i>kathaper</i>) [the art of] <b><i>weaving</i></b> supervises and directs the carders [and others] …” (308d) The Visitor [statesman’s art = weaving]</p>
                        <p>21. This weaving imagery continues into the next section (309b) where the Visitor specifies how “<i>people with courageous natures</i>, <b>like <i>the warp in weaving</i></b> (<i>hoîon stêmonophyes</i>),”<i> </i>are spun together by the statesman’s art with “<i>those of opposite inclinations </i>towards moderation, thick and soft and, to continue the simile (<i>kata tên eikona</i>), [<b>like] <i>the threads of the woof</i></b> (<i>krokôdei dianêmati proschrômenas</i>).” [courage &gt; moderation = the warp &gt; the woof]</p>
                        <p>The Visitor summarizes this relationship between ‘kingly weaving’ (<i>basilikês <i>synhyphanseôs</i></i>) and governing at 310e and continuing to the end of the Dialogue (311c).</p>

                        <p>2. “My [<i>wisdom </i>(<i>sophia</i>)] would be somewhat slight (<i>phaulê tis</i>), and doubtful (<i>amphisbêtêsimos</i>), <b>like</b> <b><i>a dream</i></b> (<i>hôsper onar ousa</i>).” (175e) Socrates [wisdom = a dream]</p>
                        <p>3. “For perhaps Heraclitus [Frg. 51 Diels-Krantz] means—since he does not express himself clearly—that <i>the One</i> (<i>to hen</i>) at variance with itself is brought into agreement with itself (<i>diapheromenon autô hautôi sympheresthai</i>), <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) [the] <b><i>harmony of a bow and a lyre</i></b> (<i>harmonian toxou te kai lyras</i>).” (187a) Eryximachus [the One = harmony of a bow and lyre]</p>

                        <p>5–6. “<i>He</i> [<i>Zeus</i>] began to cut the humans in two, <b>like</b> <b><i>people slicing sorb-apples</i></b> (<i>hôsper hoi ta oa temnontes</i>) to pickle them or <b>like</b> <b><i>people </i></b>[<b><i>slicing</i></b>]<b><i> eggs</i></b> (<i>hôsper hoi ta ôia</i> ) with hairs (<i>thrixin</i>).” (190d) Aristophanes [Zeus = people slicing apples; = people slicing eggs]</p>
                        <p>7. “[Then Apollo turned their faces around] drawing their <i>skin together</i> at the part now called the belly <b>like</b> <b><i>draw-string purses</i></b> (<i>hôsper ta syspasta ballantia</i>).” (190e) Aristophanes [their navel skin pulled together = draw-string purses]</p>
                        <p>8. “For up until then <i>they</i> hid their genitals (<i>ta aidoîa</i>) on the outside and copulated not in each other but in the ground, <b>like</b> <b><i>cicadas</i></b> (<i>hôsper hoi tettiges</i>).” (191b) Aristophanes [they = cicadas or crickets]</p>
                        <p>9. “Thus <i>each of us</i> is a tally of a human being (<i>anthropou symbolon</i>), since he has been sliced <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>a</i> <i>flatfish</i></b> (<i>psêttai</i>) making him two out of one.” (191d) Aristophanes [early <i>anthrôpoi</i> = flatfish] Thus destroying the ideal union of “one from two” (<i>ek dyoîn heî</i>s, 192e).</p>
                        <p>10–11. “There is fear that if we fail to behave [= are not orderly towards the gods], <i>we</i> shall be split again and go around <b>like</b> <b><i>figures worked in relief on grave-stones</i></b> (<i>hôsper hoi en taîs stêlais katagraphên ektetypômenoi</i>), sawn in half down our noses, becoming <b>like</b> <b><i>tokens of split dice</i></b> (<i>hôsper lispai</i>). “ (193a) Aristophanes [we = grave-stone figures in relief; = tokens of split dice] Aristophanes according to Plato is obviously fond of similes [4–11], as is Alcibiades [14–16].</p>
                        <p>12. “[<i>The student of love</i>] must be led to the branches of knowledge (<i>epistêmes</i>) … and looking on beauty in the mass (<i>pros poly</i>) may escape from beauty in the individual (<i>tôi para eni</i>), <b>like</b> an <b><i>attendant</i></b> (<i>hôsper oiketês</i>) loving the beauty of a child or some man or one practice (<i>epitêdeumatos</i>).” (210d) Diotima to Socrates [student of love = an attendant]</p>
                        <p>13. “This is the correct way <i>to proceed towards erotics</i> or to be led by someone, starting from the beautiful aspects of a particular handsome individual to advance upwards, <b>just as</b> <b><i>using steps</i></b> (<i>hôsper epanabasmoîs chrômenoi</i>) from one to two and from two to all handsome bodies (<i>sômata</i>) … to beautiful practices (<i>epitêdeumata</i>) … to beautiful lessons (<i>mathêmata</i>) and to knowledge (<i>to mathêma</i>) itself, which is to know finally what beauty is (<i>to kalon</i>).” (211c) Diotima to Socrates [progress in erotics = climbing steps]</p>
                        <p>14–15. “I am going to try to praise Socrates … through images (<i>= </i>similes<i>, eikonôn</i>) … and the purpose of the comparison (<i>hê eikôn</i>) will be to tell the truth (<i>toû alêthous</i>), not to ridicule (<i>toû geloiou</i>). For I say that <i>he </i>[<i>Socrates</i>] is <b>most similar to</b> (<i>homoiotaton</i>) <b><i>those Silenuses</i></b> (<i>toîs silênois</i>) sitting in the statuaries’ shops …” (215a) —“Moreover I say that <i>he</i> <b>is like</b> (<i>eoikenai</i>) the <b><i>satyr Marsyas</i></b> (<i>tôi satyrôi Marsyai</i>).” (215b) Alcibiades [Socrates = a Silenus; Socrates = the satyr Marsyas]</p>
                        <p>In this detailed comparison that continues through 216 the ‘visual images’ (<i>eikônes</i>) are first presented in the normal fashion of similes, with <i>protheses</i> (“most similar too” and “is like”); but as his description continues, Alcibiades leaves out such introductory expressions and speaks of Socrates directly as an <i>aulos</i>-player: “Are you not [<i>ouk</i> + <i>eî</i> from the previous sentence) an <i>aulêtês</i> much more wonderful [than] him (<i>ekeinou</i>) [Marsyas]?” (215b) and a little later as “this Marsyas” (215e) and “this satyr” (216c). These expressions illustrate the easy transition between similes with and without <i>protheses</i>.</p>
                        <p>16. “So <i>I </i>force myself to <i>flee from him</i> (Socrates) blocking my ears <b>as though</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>running from the Sirens</i></b> in order not to grow old sitting beside him.” (216a) Alcibiades [I fleeing from Socrates = running from the Sirens]</p>

Socrates diagnoses Theaetetus as being in pain from a kind of pregnancy (<i>kyoûnta</i>) and that he as the son of a midwife (<i>maîas hyon</i>) can help him. (151b–c) Plato’s language stops short of saying that Socrates is like a midwife (I have what midwives have [<i>tode ge kai emoi hyparchei hoper taîs maîais</i>]), although Socrates does use a predicate form: “the god compels <i>me</i> to serve<b> as a <i>midwife</i></b> (<i>maieuesthai me ho theos anakazei</i>), but has prevented me from having children (<i>gennân</i>).” [I = a midwife]</p>

                        <p>9–10. “But <i>you </i>[<i>Socrates</i>] seem to me to <b>tend more towards</b> <b><i>Sciron</i></b> (<i>mâllon teinein pros Skirôna</i>), for the Lacedaimonians order people to leave or else undress, but <i>you</i> <b>seem to play the role rather like</b> <b><i>Antaeus</i></b> (<i>kat’ Antaîon ti moi mâllon dokeîs to drâma drân</i>) for you do not allow anyone who approaches you to pass before you compel him to strip and wrestle with you in argument.” (169a–b) Theodorus [you/Socrates = Sciron or Antaeus] Socrates replies (169b): “You compared my illness excellently, Theaetetus. But I am more stubborn than they. For thousands of Heracleses and Theseuses are strong in speaking.”</p>
                        <p>11. “<i>Those who have spent time in the courts</i> from their youth on seem to me to be <b>like</b> (<i>hôs</i>) <b><i>house-slaves</i></b> (<i>oiketai</i>) compared to free men (<i>pros eleutherous</i>) brought up in philosophy.” (172c–d) Socrates [court-room devotés = house-slaves]</p>
                        <p>12–13. “[Socrates,] you spoke well when you said that we who belong to this ‘<i>chorus’</i> are not the <b><i>servants</i></b> of our arguments, but <i>the arguments</i> are <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>our servants</i></b>; and each of them (i.e. the arguments) must wait for us to be finished, whenever we decide; for <i>we</i> have neither judge nor any spectator set over us <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>the poets</i></b> to censure and rule us.” (173c) Theodoros [arguments = our servants; we the chorus ≠<i> </i>servants of arguments; we ≠ the poets]</p>

                        <p>15. “<i>Calling Socrates to an argument</i> [<b>is</b> <b>like</b>] <b><i>calling</i> </b>(literally: he calls)<b><i> the cavalry to an open plain</i></b> (<i>hippeas eis pedion prokaleî Sokratê eis logous prokaloumenos</i>).” (183d) Theodorus [calling Socrates to an argument = calling the cavalry onto an open plain] A proverbial expression.</p>
                        <p>16. “For the sake of argument (the <i>logos</i>) assume that in our souls there is a wax mold … Let us say that it is a gift of Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses, and <i>whatever we want to remember </i>of the things we see and hear … we stamp on this <b>as though</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>making impressions from seal rings</i></b>.” (191c–d) Socrates (comparing memories to waxen tablets placed in our souls by Mnemosyne) [remembering something = stamping on a wax mold in our soul with a signet ring]</p>
                        <p>17–19. “One final subject then is [the source of] false opinions: for example, when recognizing you (Theaetetus) and Theodorus, and having <i>the imprints of both of you</i> on that block of wax, <b>as if</b> you were <b><i>signet-rings</i></b> (<i>hôsper daktyliôn</i>) but seeing you both at a distance and indistinctly, I try to assign the proper imprint of each of you to the proper vision, and to make it fit its own footprint to ensure recognition; but if <i>I interchange them,</i> and put the vision of one upon the imprint of the other, <b>as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>people put a shoe on the wrong foot</i></b>; or, see the right side on the left, <b>as</b> (<i>hoîa</i>) the <b><i>sight is affected when we look in a mirror</i></b> I make the same mistake.” (193b–c) Socrates [your impressions = signet rings; errors in vision = putting a shoe on the wrong foot; errors in vision = looking in a mirror and seeing the sides reversed]</p>

(194a) Socrates [error = a bad archer missing the target] This group of similes (17–20) is on the subject of errors in argument.</p>
                        <p>21. “If a man bought a cloak (<i>himation</i>) … but did not wear it, we could say, not that he had (<i>echein</i>) it, but that he possessed (<i>kektêsthai</i>) it. (197b) Now see if it is possible in the same way to possess knowledge and not have it, <b>just as if</b> someone (<i>hôsper ei tis</i>) had caught some <b>wild birds</b> (<i>ornithes agrias</i>) pigeons (<i>peristeras</i>) or something else, after preparing an aviary (<i>peristeriôna</i>) and raised them at home.” (197c) “Now moreover in each soul let us put <b>a kind of</b> <b>aviary</b> (<i>peristeriôna tina</i>) [stocked] with all sorts of birds etc. (197d) … but instead of birds (<i>anti ornithôn</i>) we perceive types of <i>knowledge</i> (<i>epistemas</i>) (197e). Socrates to Theaetetus [knowledge = wild birds caught and placed in an aviary in our soul]</p>
                        <p>22. The <i>hunt for knowledge</i> (<i>thêran epistêmôn</i>) [<b>is</b>] an <b><i>art</i></b> (<i>technê</i>, 198a); let us call (<i>kalômen</i>) teaching (<i>didaskein</i>) transmitting an art [e.g. the science of number (<i>epistêmas tôn arithmôn</i>)], <i>learning</i> (<i>manthanein</i>) receiving (<i>paralabonta</i>) them (e.g. numbers); and <i>knowing</i> (<i>epistasthai</i>) [<b>let us call</b>] <b><i>keeping them in an aviary</i></b>.” (198b) Socrates [hunt for knowledge = hunting birds; knowing = keeping them in an aviary] In the next section (198c–d) Socrates refers to this ‘simile’ again: ‘continuing our comparison with the acquisition and hunting of pigeons’ (<i>ap<b>eikazo</b>ntes têi tôn peristerôn ktêsei te kai thêrai</i>).</p>
                        <p>23. “The injunction (<i>h<i>ê</i> epitaxis</i>)<i> </i>of <i>adding reason </i>(<i>logos</i>)<i> to right opinion</i> (<i>orthê</i> <i>doxa</i>) <b>might more justly be called</b> (<i>kaloîto dikaioteron</i>) a <b><i>blind man giving directions</i></b> (<i>typhlou parakeleusis</i>), … <b>very much</b> <b>like</b> (<i>pany gennaiôs eoiken</i>) <b><i>a man whose sight has darkened</i></b> (<i>ekotômenôi</i>).” (209d–e) Socrates [adding reason to right opinion = a blind man giving directions = a man whose sight has darkened]</p>

                        <p>According to Lamb (Introduction, 345), on the basis of stylistics (e.g. “sadly lacking in the usual of Socratic humour”) it must be considered an imitation of probably the second century B.C. “by a careful student of Plato’s writings who wished to emphasize the mystical side of Socrates.” See Appendix III-2 for the string of analogies introduced by Socrates (123b–124e) to elucidate educational instruction.</p>

                        <p><b>Timaeus</b> (St III.17a–92c) = Rev. R. G. Bury, LCL 1942 (1929) [Plato VII (IX)]</p>
                        <p><i>On the nature of the physical world.</i></p>
                        <p>“Professedly a sequel to the <i>Republic</i>, portions of which are recapitulated in the prefatory chapter, it is also the first section of a projected trilogy, which was intended to contain also a <i>Critias</i> (of which only a fragment remains) and a <i>Hermocrates</i>.” (Introduction 3) There are three sections: (1) Introduction (19a–27c), Making of the Soul of the World (27c–69a), and Making of Man’s Soul and Body (69a–end). The last section has the majority of similes [9–33].</p>
                        <p>1. (Socrates describes his proposal for today’s discussion with a simile:) “My feeling (<i>to pathos</i>) may be something like (<i>proseoike</i>) this: <b>such as if</b> (<i>hoîon ei</i>) someone seeing <b><i>beautiful creatures</i></b> (<i>zôa</i>)—whether works of art or actually alive but in repose—he should desire to see them moving and engaged in some exercise suitable to their physique. This is what I feel regarding <i>the state</i> (<i>polin</i>) we have described.” (19b–c) Socrates [the (hypothetical) state = beautiful creatures at rest]</p>
                        <p>Timaeus is asked to do this because he is from the well-governed <i>polis</i> of Italian Locris where he has held high office. Socrates’ request here is reminiscent of his suggestion in the <i>Republic</i> (see <i>Republic</i> 2 [2]) that they study justice in a city rather than in a person so they can see it better.</p>
                        <p>2–3. “Again after the usual [number of] years, a <i>heavenly</i> <i>flood </i>(<i>rheûma ouranion</i>) comes borne along <b>like</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) <b><i>a plague</i></b> (<i>nosêma</i>) and has left you unlettered and uncultured so that again from the beginning <i>you </i>become <b>as</b><i> <b>children</b></i> (<i>hoîon neoi</i>) knowing nothing.” (23a–b) Egyptian Priest [heavenly flood = a disease; you = children] Critias repeats his grandfather’s (Critias the Elder) account (<i>logos</i>) as he heard it from his great-grandfather Dropides, who heard it from Solon (20e), who heard it on his visit to Sais in the Delta of Egypt from one of the priests.</p>
                        <p>4. So your <i>genealogies</i> which you related just now, O Solon, <b>differ</b> <b>little from</b> (<i>brachy ti diapherei</i>) <b><i>children’s stories</i></b> (<i>mythôn</i>).” (23b) Again, the Egyptian Priest [Greek genealogies = (children’s) stories]</p>
                        <p>5. “[The Creator] contrived (<i>emêchanêsato</i>) <i>earth</i> (<i>gên</i>), <i>our nurse</i> (<i>trophon</i>), [to be/as] <b><i>guard</i></b> (<i>phylaka</i>) and fashioner (<i>dêmiourgon</i>) of night and day.” (40b) Timaeus [earth, our nurse = guard] In the <i>Phaedo</i> earth is compared to something like a bowl (<i>Phaedo</i> [11]) and a leather ball (<i>Phaedo</i> [16]).</p>
                        <p>6. “Having arranged everything, he [the father of the universe] divided the souls [to make them] equal to (<i>isarhithmous</i>) the stars (<i>toîs astrois</i>) in number and assigned <i>each to its own </i>[<i>star</i>] and mounting [each on a <i>star</i>] <b>as </b>(<i>hôs</i>)<i> <b>on a chariot</b></i> (<i>es ochêma</i>) he showed them the nature of the whole [universe].” (41d–e) Timaeus [soul on a star = on a chariot] Cf. 69c (below [10]).</p>
                        <p>7. The two divine revolutions … they bound within a <b><i>sphere</i></b>&#8211;<i>shape</i>d (<i>sphairoeides</i>) <i>body</i>.” (44d) Timaeus [shape of body = a sphere] NB the simile embedded in an adjective.</p>
                        <p>8. “It is fitting <b>to liken</b> (<i>proseikasai prepei</i>) the <i>recipient</i> (<i>to dechomenon</i> [= the substance that receives all bodies]) to the <b><i>mother</i></b> (<i>mêtri</i>), the <i>source</i> (<i>to d’hothen</i>) to the <b><i>father</i></b> (<i>patri</i>) and <i>what is between</i> these two (<i>tên de metaxu toutôn</i>) to the <b><i>offspring</i></b> (<i>ekgonôi</i>).” (50d) Timaeus [recipient = mother, source = father, what is between = offspring]</p>
                        <p>9. “Now that we have lying before us—<b>like</b> <b><i>wood</i></b> (<i>hoîa tektosin hêmîn hulê</i>)<i> </i>ready for the joiners—the various kinds of <i>causes </i>(<i>ta tôn aitiôn genê diulasmena</i>)<i> …</i>” (69a) Timaeus [causes = wood]</p>
                        <p>10. “[God’s sons], imitating him, considering the beginning of soul as immortal, framed around this a mortal body (<i>thnêton sôma</i>) and gave (<i>edosan</i>) <i>all the body</i> [<b>as</b>]<i> <b>a vehicle</b></i> (<i>ochêma</i>) <b><i>for the soul</i></b> (<i>autêi = psychê</i>).” (69c) Timaeus [body = vehicle for the soul]</p>
                        <p>11. “[Within the soul the gods placed] a mortal form of soul which has within it firstly <i>pleasure</i> (<i>hêdonên</i>), a <b><i>mighty lure to evil</i></b> (<i>delear kakoû</i>), then <i>pains</i>, <b><i>routers of good</i></b> (<i>agathôn phygas</i>) and <i>rashness and fear</i>, both <b><i>foolish counselors</i></b> (<i>aphrone xymboulô</i>).” (69d) Timaeus [pleasure = a mighty lure to evil; pains = routers of good; rashness and fear = foolish counselors]</p>
                        <p>12–14. They implanted the form of the <i>lung</i>(s) (<i>tou pleumonos</i>) … having within it (a) <i>cavities</i> (<i>sêrangas</i>) <b>like</b> <b><i>a sponge</i></b> (<i>hoîon spongou</i>) (70c)—and (b) they placed <i>it </i>[<i>the lung</i>(<i>s</i>)] around the heart (<i>kardian</i>) <b>like</b> a <b><i>padding</i></b> (<i>hoîon malagma</i>) (70d) —(13) And <i>the part of the soul that is desirous of food and drink</i> … [they placed in the midriff] towards the navel (<i>omphalon</i>) <b>like</b> <b><i>a manger</i></b> (<i>hoîon phatnên</i>) for the feeding of the body (<i>têi tou sômatos trophê</i>). (14) —And they tied up [<i>this part of the soul</i>]<i> </i><b>like</b> a <b><i>savage beast</i></b> (<i>hôs thremma agrion</i>). (70e) Timaeus [lungs = a sponge and padding; stomach = a manger and a savage beast]</p>
                        <p>15. “He fashioned the form of the <i>liver</i> (<i>hêpatos</i>) dense and smooth … so that the power of thoughts … moving [in the liver] <b>as</b> <b><i>in a mirror</i></b> (<i>hoîon en katoptrôi</i>) … should frighten this part of the soul.” (71b) Timaeus [the liver = a mirror] Cf. 72e.</p>
                        <p>16. “The structure of [the <i>spleen,</i> <i>hê splênos</i>, next sentence] is for the sake of the liver, to keep it bright and clean, <b>as</b> <b><i>a wiper</i></b> (<i>hoîon … ekmageîon</i>) that is laid <b><i>beside a mirror</i></b> (<i>katoptrôi … parakeimenon</i>).” (72c) Timaeus [spleen = a wiper beside a mirror]</p>
                        <p>17. “… and from these shapes of <i>marrow</i> (<i>myelon</i>) [i.e. the bones and marrow in the verticle column of the backbone), <b>as</b> from <b><i>anchors</i></b> (<i>kathaper ex angkyrôn</i>), he cast out bands of the whole soul. (73d) Timaeus [marrow = anchors]</p>
                        <p>18. “Around the marrow of neck and back He moulded <i>vertebrae</i> of bone (<i>sphondylou</i>) and set them in a vertical row <b>like</b> <b><i>pivots</i></b> (<i>hoîon strophingas</i>) throughout the whole trunk beginning from the head.” (74a) Timaeus [vertebrae = pivots]</p>
                        <p>19–20. “He designed (<i>emêchanâto</i>) the <i>flesh</i> [<b>as, to be</b>] <b><i>a shield</i></b> (<i>probolê</i>) against heat and a shelter (<i>problêma</i>) against the cold and so that it should yield softly and gently in case of falls, (20) <b>like</b> <b><i>padded garments</i></b> (<i>hoîon ta pilêta esthêmata</i> <a href="#n8" name="a8">[8]</a>). (74b) Timaeus [flesh = a shield = padded garments]</p>
                        <p>21–22. “The superior powers, as nourishment for us lesser beings, provided <i>fluid</i> for our bodies by cutting [<i>veins</i>] <b>like</b> <b><i>channels in gardens</i></b> (<i>hoîon en kêpois ochetous</i>) so that [each body] might receive <i>moisture</i> <b>just as</b> (<i>hôsper</i>) from a <b><i>spring</i></b> (<i>ek namatos</i>) coming to it.” (77c) Timaeus [veins in the body = channels in a garden; fluid from veins = a spring]</p>
                        <p>23–24. “The god [used these things] to provide water from the belly to the veins, weaving a <i>web</i> of air and fire (<i>plegma ex aeros kai pyros</i>) <b>like</b><i> <b>a fish-trap</b></i> (<i>hoîon hoi kyrtoi</i>) … (24) from the <i>funnels</i> (<i>apo tôn engkyrtiôn</i>) he stretched <b>something like</b><i> <b>reeds</b></i> (<i>hoîon schoinous</i>) in a circle throughout the whole structure. (78b) Timaeus [web of air and fire = a fish-trap; with funnels = reeds]</p>
                        <p>25–26. “With respiration the inner fire dissolves <i>meats and drinks</i> and disperses them through the outlets … <b>like</b> (<i>hoîon</i>) <b><i>water</i></b> <b><i>drawn into channels</i></b> from a spring and thus causes … the <i>veins</i> (<i>tas phlebas</i>) <i>to flow</i> through the body <b>as</b> through a <b><i>pipe</i></b> (<i>hôsper aulônos</i>).” (79a) Timaeus [meats and drinks = water in channels; veins flow through the body = through a pipe]</p>
                        <p>27. “and all this <i>breathing</i> (<i>anepnoê</i>, 79a) takes place as one simultaneous <i>process</i> (<i>hama</i>), <b>like </b>(<i>hoîon</i>) a revolving <b><i>wheel</i></b> (<i>trochoû preiagomenoû</i>).” (79b) Timaeus [breathing process = a wheel]</p>
                        <p>28–29. “Every living creature (<i>pan zôon</i>) has its <i>inward parts</i> around the blood and veins (<i>peri to haîma kai tas phlebas</i>) very <i>hot</i>, <b>like</b> a <b><i>fount of fire</i></b> within (<i>hoion </i><i style="line-height: 1.5em">… pêgên tina enoûsan . . . pyros</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">) and </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em">we have compared</b><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> (</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">kai prosêikazomen</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">) </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">this region</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> already to the envelope of a </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em"><i>fish-weel</i></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> (</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">tôi tou kyrtou plegmati</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">).” (79d) Timaeus [hot inward parts = a fount of fire; this region = a fish-weel]</span></p>

[The <i>bile</i>] … burning through loosens the [<i>fibers</i>]<i> of the soul</i> <b>like</b><i> <b>the moorings of a ship</b></i> (<i>hoîon neôs peismata</i>)” (85e) and forced through the veins into the lower region … <b>like</b><i> <b>an exile</b> </i>(<i>hoîon phygas</i>)<i> </i>from a city in civil war (<i>ek poleôs stasiasasês</i>) falling from the body causes diarrhoea, dysentery and all such illnesses.” (86a) Timaeus [fibers of the soul = moorings of a ship; bile = an exile]</p>
                        <p>32. “And whenever <i>a man’s seed</i> (<i>sperma</i>) grows abundant in his marrow (<i>poly kai rhyôdes peri ton muelon</i>) <b>like</b> <b><i>a tree that is overburdened with fruit</i></b> (<i>kathaperei dendron polykarpoteron tou xymmetrou</i>) … he suffers many pangs and pleasures.” (86c) Timaeus [a man’s seed = a tree overburdened with fruit]</p>
                        <p>33. “Because in men the <i>nature of the genital organs</i> (<i>tôn andrôn to peri tên tôn aidoiôn physin</i>) is disobedient and tyrannical, <b>like<i> an animal</i></b><i> <b>deaf to reason</b></i> (<i>hoîon zôon anypêkoon toû logou</i>), it tries to dominate everything through its frenzied lusts (<i>di’ epithymias oistrôdeis</i>).

                        <p>34. “And in women (<i>en taîs gynaixin</i>) too and for the same reasons the so-called (<i>legomenai</i>) <i>matrix or womb</i> (<i>mêtrai te kai hysterai</i>), a <b><i>living creature</i></b> (<i>zôion epithymêtikon</i>)<i> </i>longing to become pregnant, whenever it remains without fruit (<i>akarpon</i>) long beyond its due season, it takes it badly and wandering around everywhere inside the body (<i>planômenon pantêi kata to sôma</i>), blocking up the breathing passages …&#8221; (91c) Timaeus [a woman’s womb = an animal wandering inside her body]</p>
