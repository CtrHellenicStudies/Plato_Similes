                                <h2>1. Similes in Homer</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>1§1. Poetic similes are not are main concern here, but a brief comparison with Homer is instructive. D. J. N. Lee found three hundred and thirty similes in the <em>Iliad</em> and one hundred and seventeen in the <em>Odyssey</em> (not counting certain very short phrases “which seem more like traditional epithets or fossilized similes.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.1">1</a>]</span> <a name="noteref_n.1"></a>The number of similes in each book varies greatly (as in Plato’s Dialogues): <em>Iliad</em> Book One has three whereas Book Eleven has thirty-one. It is difficult to draw conclusions about this, other than very general observations about the need for more similes in battle descriptions that may have seemed tedious and repetitive; on the other hand, according to Martin Mueller, ”[r]ather than provide variety and relief, the dominant simile families underscore the austerity of the poem and intensify its obsession with force and violence.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.2">2</a>]</span> <a name="noteref_n.2"></a>Whereas in Homer “[s]imiles occur predominantly in battle scenes”,<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.3">3</a>]</span><a name="noteref_n.3"></a> in Plato most similes are part of the dialogue (e.g. Socrates or another speaker says them) – there is never any description apart from what the various speakers say. In Homer (again quoting Mueller, 221 in Bloom) “[s]imiles are drawn from a wide range of phenomena but with a very uneven distribution. A handful of simile families account for well over two-thirds of all occurrences. By far the largest group is made up of hunter-hunted similes.” Moulton notes that not only are many of the similes in the <em>Odyssey</em> much shorter than those in the <em>Iliad</em>, but they more often “evoke a response to the major themes of the epic.” Weather and sea similes, which are frequent in the <em>Iliad</em>, play a very small part in the <em>Odyssey</em>, where these elements are important in the narrative.<span class="noteref">[<a href="#n.4">4</a>] </span><a name="noteref_n.4"></a></p>

                                    <p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">1§2. To take a few examples from the </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">Iliad</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em">, in Book One Apollo’s </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">arrival is compared to night (47: </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">ho d’ êïe </em><em><strong>nykti </strong></em><em>eoikôs</em>) and later Thetis comes to Achilles “<strong>like</strong><em> </em><em><strong>a mist </strong></em>of the grey sea” (359: <em>anedy </em><em>poliês </em><em>halos </em><em><strong>êüt’ </strong></em><em><strong>omichlê</strong></em>). These are narrative similes but in Achilles’ retorts to Agamemnon he uses a denominative simile (159, ‘dog-faced’ [<em>kynôpa</em>]). Two more similetic phrases are “rosy-fingered dawn” (477, <em>rhododaktylos Êôs</em>) and, perhaps, Thetis rising [on/as] “a wave of the sea” (496, <em>kûma</em><em> thalassês</em>). The first extended similes in the <em>Iliad</em> occur in Book Two and there are several. The first one (2.87–90) compares the Greek troops rushing to assembly from their ships and huts to swarms of bees thronging from a hollow rock to spring flowers. Soon after this two more similes compare the commotion as they leave the assembly to waves raised by the East and South Winds (144–146) and to a ‘corn-field’ blasted by Zephyrus (147–149).</p>

                                    <p>1§3. Although most Homeric similes are part of the narrative (Greeks are like bees, waves or screaming geese, etc.), a few are spoken by men (like Glaucus to Diomedes in Book Six or Achilles to Odysseus in Book Nine) and are quite poignant: for example, Glaucus’ comparison of men to falling leaves (at 6.146–149) or Achilles’ simile depicting himself as a mother bird (9.323–325: <em>hôs d’ornis</em> …<em> hôs kai egô</em>). Helene Foley discusses what she calls ‘reverse similes’ in the <em>Odyssey</em> whereby the comparison evokes “an inversion of social roles or a social theme with an equivalent difference of focus or point of view”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.5">5</a>]</span><a name="noteref_n.5"></a>: men are compared with women, fathers to children and the conqueror or Troy to helpless victims. Carroll Moulton has pointed out that a unique feature of the Odyssean simile is that it reminds us of an important theme of the poem. Thus similes in Homer are generally longer than those in Plato and fulfill an entirely different purpose.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.6">6</a>] </span><a name="noteref_n.6"></a></p>

                                <h2>2. Similes in Hesiod</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">2§1. In comparison with Homer there are not as many similes in the poems of Hesiod as you would expect, perhaps because they are not narrative poems but rather poetic treatises of advice and instruction (<em>Works and Days</em>) and cosmogony (<em>Theogony</em>). It is interesting to find that, as in Plato, drone bees are the subject of comparison (in both poems). At <em>Works and Days</em> 304 an idle man (<em>aergos</em>) is said to be “like (<em>eikelos</em>) <em>stingless drones </em>(<em>kêphênessi kothoupois</em>) in nature (<em>orgên</em>).” And at <em>Theogony</em> 594–601 the same simile is used rather inappropriately to characterize women: ‘As when (<em>hôs d’hopot’</em>) in thatched hives (<em>smênessi</em>) bees (<em>melissai</em>) feed the drones (<em>kêphênas</em>) whose nature is to do mischief—all day long throughout the day until the sun goes down they [the bees] are busy laying white combs, while they (<em>hoi</em>, the drones) stay at home and reap the toil of others into their own bellies—even so (<em>hôs<br />
                                    d’autôs</em>) Zeus who thunders on high made women (<em>gynaîkas</em>) to be an evil to mortal men, with a nature to do evil.’ In nature female bees (<em>melissai</em>) feed the lazy male drones (<em>kêphênas </em><em>hoi</em>).</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>2§2. Most of the short comparisons occur in the first part of the poem (<em>Works</em> 1–382): the lame god fashioned [clay] in shape of (<em>ikelon</em>) a modest maid (71); they lived like gods (112 – <em>hôste theoi</em>); [the silver generation] was like (<em>enaligkion</em>) the golden (<em>chryseôi</em>) [race] neither in body nor spirit (129); in no way equal to the silver race (144, <em>argyreôi ouden homoîon</em>). There are also a couple of denominative (‘epithet’) similes: <em>honey-sweet</em> fruit (172, <em>meliêdea </em><em>karpon</em> = ‘sweet as honey’) and “peace, <em>nurse of children</em> (228, <em>kourotrophos</em> = peace [like] a nurse). There is another rather strange and strangely expressed simile in the second part of the poem (<em>Days</em> 383–828): “a leaf on the topmost shoot (of a) fig tree appears to a man as large as (<em>hoson</em><br />
                                        <em>tosson</em>) the footprint (<em>ichnos</em>) that a crow made” (679–680). An epithet simile occurs at 620: “misty sea” (<em>êeroeidea ponton</em>, sea <em>like </em>mist).</p>

                                    <p>2§3. One will find many aphorisms in this poem (e. g., 311: “Work is no disgrace but idleness is,” or 356, “Give is a good girl but Take is bad”), as well as alliteration (382: <em>ergon ep’ ergôi </em><em>ergazesthai</em>), passages of three lines beginning with same word (317–319 and 578–590), as well as interesting epithets (582, ‘chirping grasshopper’ [<em>êcheta<br />
                                        tettix</em>]).</p>

                                    <p>2§4. In the <em>Theogony</em> besides the example noted above there are few similetic figures. One will find a couple of denominative (epithet) similes: ‘silver-shod Thetis’ (1006, <em>argyropeza</em>, foot = (like) silver) and ‘lion-hearted Achilles’ (1007, <em>thymoleonta</em>, heart = (like) a lion’s); use of the word ‘likeness’ (<em>ikelon</em>): ‘the limping god formed from earth a likeness of (to) a shy maiden’ (571); comparisons: ‘the limping god put many creatures upon it [the crown for Pandora], wonderful things, like (<em>eoikota</em>) living beings (<em>zôioisin</em>) with voices’ (584); [Zeus swallowed Metis for fear that] she might bring forth something stronger than his thunderbolt (<em>kraterôteron allo keraunoû</em>)’ (937).</p>

Of the five reasons we have found for similes in Plato (see Summary and Conclusion III), only the first two seem to fit Hesiod: (a) clarification by visualization (abstract made concrete); (b) verbal clarification (to illustrate verbs); (c) clarification by differentiation (not that, but this); (d) literary embellishment; (e) humorous exaggeration.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.7">7</a>] </span><br />

                                <h2>3. Similes in Thucydides</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">

                                    <p>3§1. As Simon Hornblower has rightly observed, “on the whole Thucydides, like Homer, is not very metaphorically-minded and unlike Homer, he does not make much use of the obvious alternative (to metaphor), namely the simile.” <span class="noteref">[<a href="#n.8">8</a>]</span><a name="noteref_n.8"></a> In the first two books of his <em>History</em> more examples of metaphor and personification may be found than of simile: e.g., “All Hellas <strong>is stirred</strong> by our enterprise and <strong>fixes her gaze</strong> upon it” (1.11.3). An occasional predicate or denominative simile may be cited: “the sun became <em>crescent-shaped</em>” (<em>ho hêlios</em> … <em>genomenos </em><em><strong>mênoeidês </strong></em>at 1.28, in reference to the eclipse of the sun in August, 431 BCE); or Archidamus’ advice to the Lacedaimonians (1.82.4): “consider the <em>land of Athens </em>[<strong>as</strong>] a <em><strong>hostage</strong></em>.” No similes are found in the description of the plague (2.47–54) or in the speeches, which are characterized instead by gnomic statements and aphorisms: e.g. “to refrain from wrongdoing equals is a surer strength than to be carried away by present appearances” (1.42–44; also1.69.2; 1.69.6; 1.71.5; 1.77.4; and 1.83.2). One finds many antitheses and aphorisms about Athens and Sparta throughout (e.g., 1.70.8–9). Pericles’ last speech (2.60–64), like most speeches in Thucydides, is characterized by gnomic statements: e.g., “the spirit is cowed by that which is sudden” (2.61.3) and “it is a greater disgrace to lose a possession than to fail in attempting to acquire a new one” (61.4). Typical also are distinctions between concepts, as in the long chapter on Thucydides’ estimate of Pericles (2.65), where he calls Athens “in name a democracy (<em>dêmokratia</em>) but in fact a rule (<em>archê</em>) of its foremost citizen.”</p>

                                    <p>3§2. No similes occur in the funeral oration attributed to Pericles (2.35–46) although it is highly rhetorical with features such as balanced clauses, antitheses, alliteration and abstract expressions. The most famous example no doubt is the sentence at 40: “We are lovers of beauty … and lovers of wisdom …” (<em>philokaloûmen</em> … <em>philosophoûmen</em>);  also “not by allowing but by doing” (<em>ou gar paschontes eû alla drôntes</em> [40.4]); “the whole city is the school of Greece” (<em>tên te pâsan polin tês Hellados paideusin eînai </em>[41.1]); “not of words but rather of deeds” (<em>ou logôn</em> … <em>mâllon ê ergôn</em> [41.2]). Abstract nouns are characteristic: <em>dynamis</em> = power (41.2 and 4; 43.1); <em>katastrophê</em> = destruction (42.3); <em>tychê</em> = fate (42.4); <em>metabolê</em> = change (43.5); <em>hê kakôsis</em> = ill-treatment (43.6); <em>phthonos</em> = envy (45.1). He rejects the eulogies of poets (41.4): “We don’t need either Homer to praise us or anyone who will please us momentarily with words but the truth will harm the supposition of deeds.”</p>

                                    <p>3§4. As Aristotle quotes Pericles’ funeral oration in his <em>Rhetoric</em> (Bk I.7.34 and in a slightly different form at 3.10.7), there is the famous simile: “as Pericles said in his funeral oration, that <em>the youth were taken away</em> (<em>anêirêsthai</em>) from the city <strong>as though </strong>(<em>hôsper</em>) <strong><em>the spring had been removed</em></strong> (<em>exairetheiê</em>) from the year” (see Introduction, above, section A.1). But in Thucydides’ version (2.35–44) there are only two predicate similes: “<em>our city </em><strong>is<em> </em><em>the school of </em><em>Hellas</em></strong>” (2:41: <em>pasan polin paidousin tês Hellados</em>) and “the <em>whole world </em><strong>is</strong> the <strong><em>sepulchre of famous </em><em>men</em></strong>” (2.43: <em>andrôn yap epiphanôn pasa gê taphos</em>).</p>

                                    <p>4§1. As with Homer we can make here only a few observations about the similes in the Socratic works of Xenophon: <em>Apology</em>, <em>Memorabilia</em>, <em>Oeconomicus</em> and <em>Symposium</em>. It is, however, relevant to note them since it is interesting to see how Plato’s contemporary portrayed Socrates in this respect. Like Plato, Xenophon placed the great majority of similes in the mouth of Socrates. While many similes may be found in the three other works, they do not occur in the <em>Apology</em>, although there are several simple comparisons.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.9">9</a>]</span><a name="noteref_n.9"></a> This absence is curious given the seven colorful similes that Plato attributes to Socrates in his <em>Apology</em>.</p>

Although he does not use the word (Xenophon’s phrase is <em>en tôi suggrammati</em>,’in the text’), Prodicus’ allegory of Virtue and Vice (<em>Aretê</em> and <em>Kaka</em>) in <em>Memorabilia</em> 2.1.21–34 is a story that illustrates in greater detail than a simile would allow the value of a strenuous life.</p>

                                    <p>4§6. Conclusion. Xenophon’s portrayal of Socrates is similar to Plato’s. By including many vivid similes in his speech Xenophon reinforces the impression gained from Plato that Socrates was fond of using similes and analogies to illustrate his arguments and enhance his discourse. Few similes are placed in the mouths of other participants in Xenophon’s Socratic works. Some comparisons are reminiscent of those found in Plato (e.g., references to horses, dogs, bees) but none is identical or even closely parallel. The similes seem more mundane than those in Plato. As for language used, most similes are introduced by the word ‘just as’ (<em>hôsper</em>) or by a comparative word with ‘than’ (<em>ê</em>). Occasionally he uses other formulations found in Plato: adjectives that take the genitive (<em>Symposium</em> 5.7) or the dative (<em>Memorabilia</em> 3.8.4); ‘the same as’ (<em>tauta ha</em>: <em>Symposium </em>8.15), a simple predicate (<em>Memorabilia</em> 3.2.1), and even a verb containing the comparison (<em>Symposium</em> 4.63–64). Once Socrates uses the word <em>eikôn</em> in the sense of a our word ‘simile’ (<em>Symposium</em> 4.63–64). Xenophon also attributes gestures (<em>Apology</em> 28) and smiles (<em>Oeconomicus</em> 7.3) to Socrates and inserts several humorous references in the <em>Symposium</em>.<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.11">11</a>]</span><a name="noteref_n.11"></a> The absence of this characteristic feature in the <em>Apology</em> contributes to the impression that Xenophon’s version is less accurate than Plato’s. Gabriel Danzig suggests that Xenophon’s work “was written a long time after the trial.”<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n.12">12</a>] </span><a name="noteref_n.12"></a></p>

Although funeral orations are in the epideictic genre where you might expect similes as part of the exaggerated praise of the Athenians, they do not occur in the surviving examples in any impressive way. No statement such as this appears: e.g. <strong>Like<em> </em></strong><em><strong>eagles </strong></em>protecting their nest, the <em>Athenians</em> fought the barbarians at Salamis. Or, <em>They </em>fought the Lacedaimonians <strong>like</strong><em> </em><em><strong>lions </strong></em>for the freedom of their allies. There are no quotations from Homer or other literary sources. There is a curious similarity between the nature similes quoted above from Demosthenes and Hypereides and Aristotle’s quotation from Pericles about the spring being removed from the year. It appears that similes in prose were typically introduced more often to support an argument and bring clarity to a difficult topic in philosophical works than to grace an epideictic speech.</p>

                                    <p>6§1. No similes of more than single words appear in eleven of the thirteen Letters attributed to Plato. (Letter 4 has an analogy [321a] and a concluding aphorism [321b]). Letter #5 has two brief similes introduced by <em>kathaper </em>(<em>like</em> or <em>as</em>): “forms of government, <em>like animals</em>” (321d) and “Plato would have gladly given advice to his native demos, <em>as to a father</em>” (322b). Letter #6 concludes with an appositional poetic simile (323d): “playfulness, sister to earnestness” (<em>têi tês spoudês adelphêi paidiâi</em>).</p>

                                    <p>6§2. Letter VII (considered authentic) has several similes, with different protheses. “The man who is fond of riches but poor in soul … shamelessly plunders everything which <em>he</em> thinks likely to provide himself, <strong>like</strong><em> </em><em><strong>a beast </strong></em>(<em>kathaper thêrion</em>), with food or drink.” (335B) “When I arrived I thought I ought first to gain proof of this point—whether <em>Dionysius was really inflamed </em>(<em>exêmmenos</em>) <em>by philosophy</em> (<em>hypo philosophias</em>) <strong>as it were</strong> <em><strong>by fire </strong></em>(<em><strong>hôsper pyros</strong></em>) or all this persistent account which had come to Athens was empty rumour.” (340B) “<em>Those who are in </em><em>reality not philosophic</em> (<em>hoi de ontôs men mê philosophoi</em>), <em>but superficially tinged by opinions</em> (<em>doxais d’epikechrôsmenoi</em>), <strong>like</strong> (<em>kathaper</em>) <em><strong>men whose bodies are sunburnt on the surface </strong></em>(<em>hoi ta </em><em>sômata hypo toû hêliou epikekaumenoi</em>), when they see how many studies are required and how great labor … they become incapable of pursuing the subject.” (340D)</p>

                                    <p>6§3. The next passage from Letter 7 will be quoted at greater length because it contains the controversial passage claiming that Plato never wrote down his philosophical treatises. “There does not exist, nor will there ever exist, any treatise (<em>syggramma</em>) of mine about those things [the subjects which I seriously study]. For it [philosophical insight?] does not at all admit of verbal expression like other studies (<em>rhêton gar oudamôs estin hôs alla mathêmata</em>), but as a result of continued application to the subject itself (<em>all’ ek pollês synousias gignomenês peri to </em><em>prâgma auto</em>), <em>it</em> is brought to birth in the soul on a sudden (<em>en têi psychêi genomenon auto</em>), <strong>as<em> </em></strong><em><strong>light that is kindled by a leaping spark </strong></em>(<em>hoîon apo pyros pêdêsantos exaphthen phôs</em>), and thereafter it nourishes itself.” (341C–D) Then at 344C he tells why serious thinkers avoid writing: “And this is the reason why a very serious man (<em>pâs anêr spouaîos</em>) in dealing with really serious subjects (<em>tôn ontôs spoudaiôn peri</em>) carefully avoids writing (<em>polloû dei mê grapsas</em>), lest thereby he may possibly <strong>cast them as a prey</strong> (<i>katabalei</i>)<i> </i>to the envy and stupidity of the public.”</p>

Finally he provides two similes portraying Dionysius: “Dionysius and I lived like this: I was gazing out [of my cage] (<em>egô blepôn exô</em>), <strong>like</strong> [<em>kathaper</em>] a <em><strong>bird that is longing to fly off </strong></em>(<em>ornis </em><em>pothôn anaptesthai</em>), while he was scheming how he might shoo me back (<em>anasobêsoi</em>) without paying away any of Dion’s money; nevertheless, to the whole of Sicily we appeared to be comrades.” (347E) And “on hearing this, <em>Dionysius</em> fired up (<em>anephlechthê</em>) and went all colours (<em>chrômata</em>), <strong>just as</strong> (<em>hoîa</em>) an angry man (<em>thymoumenos</em>) would do.” (349A)</p>

                                    <p>6§5. There are two similes in Letter #8: (at 252a) “<em>to advise </em>such a policy (<em>hê toiautê xymboulê</em>) <strong>is much like</strong><em> </em><em><strong>saying a prayer </strong></em>(<em><strong>euchêi proseoiken</strong></em>) and in the final sentence (357c): “Cease not from urging your friends and opponents … until, <strong>like</strong><em> </em>(<em>hoîon</em>) a <em><strong>heaven-sent dream </strong></em>(<em>oneirata theîa</em>) presented to the waking eye, <em>the plan which I have described</em> (<em>ta nûn lechthenta hyph’ hêmôn</em>) be … brought to a happy conclusion.”</p>

                                    <p>6§6. In summary, the longest letter (#7) and most likely the only authentic Platonic composition has the most similes (six); two others have two each (Letters 5 and 8). <em>Kathaper</em> is the most common <em>prothesis</em>, although <em>hoîon</em>/<em>hoîa</em> and <em>hôsper</em> also are used in Letter #7. Eight letters (1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12) are very short (half a page to two pages); four others (2, 3, 8, 13) are longer (four to six pages); and of course Letter #7 is by far the longest (28 pages).</p>

James Redfield states it another way: “Combat is not a productive activity, but it is technical, involving planning, skill, and the use of the tools. So combat can be compared to technical activity. But when it is so compared in the <em>Iliad</em>, the effect is nearly always shocking, as when the blood runs down Menelaus’ flesh like the dye carefully traced over ivory (IV.141–47) … The technical simile usually stands in contrast to its context: a peaceful act is unexpectedly compared to the violence of war. The simile of weather and the sea, on the other hand, most often develops and reinforces the tone of its context; weather is even more violent than war.” From James M. Redfield, <em>Nature and Culture in the </em>Iliad<em>: The Tragedy of Hector</em> (The University of Chicago, 1975) = (“Landscape and Simile”) in Bloom’s <em>Homer</em> (Chelsea House Publishers, 1986) 183–84.</div>
