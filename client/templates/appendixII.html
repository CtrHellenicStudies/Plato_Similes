                                <h1><em>Vehicles</em> in the Platonic Similes</h1>
                                <h2>A. General Observations</h2>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>1.<strong> Abstract tenors + concrete vehicles</strong>: The most general observation we can make about <em>vehicles</em> is that they make abstract <em>tenors</em> (arguments, the <em>polis</em>, death, democracy, dialectic, ideas, etc.) more explicit and visual convoking either a specific object (like a worn-out coat in <em>Alcibiades</em> 1.1) or a famous name (Oedipus in <em>Alcibiades</em> 2.1) or a familiar situation (seeing someone yawning, <em>Charmides</em> 5). They often refer to familiar professions and objects (e.g., athletes, books, bowls, boxers, garments). If the tenor is abstract (part of virtue), the vehicle is concrete (pieces of gold, <em>Protagoras</em> 16). Apart from the category ‘children’, very few words are the same in the lists of tenors and vehicles. (See ‘F’ below.)</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>2. <em><strong>Tenor</strong></em> <strong>personal names</strong> are the participants in the Dialogues (Euthydemus, Protagoras, Socrates) or familiar contemporary figures (the children of Pericles, Meletus) whereas <strong>vehicle names</strong> are frequently mythical or famous figures: Achilles, Antaeus, Athena, Bacchai/Bacchants, Cerberus, Chimaera, Corybants, Creon, Crommyonian, Daedalus, Daemon, Diomedes, Eriphyle, Euryclea, Euripides, Gigantomachia, Heracles, Kriso the Himeraean (runner), Lacainian (hounds), Marsyas, Oedipus, Olympic (victor), Satyr, Sciron, Seirens, Scylla, Silenoi, Teiresias, Thetis, Troy, Typhon.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>3. The <strong>number of professions</strong> cited as vehicles is impressive: actor, archer, athletes, bathman, boxer, charioteer, chess expert, chorus, dancers, doctors, door-keeper, horse-and-cattle herder, hunter, lawyer, long-distance runner, messenger, midwife, Olympic victor, painter, physician, poet, refiners of gold, sailors, servants/slaves, sophists, tinker, weavers, wind-pourers. References to painters, for example, may be found in nine similes in the Compendium. (See ‘G’ below).</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>4. Also noteworthy is the <strong>variety of objects as vehicles</strong>: ball, book, bowl, chariot, coping stone, garment, iron, jug, magnet, millstone, moorings of a ship, net, plate, pots, rings, ships, shuttle, sieve, skull, statue, vehicle, wax tablets. Comparisons taken from health (disease, dissolution, dreams, glutton, itch, phlegm or bile, plague, sickness, sleep) and nature (beast, cave, channels in a garden, farmer, fruit, gold, marsh/swamp, planting crops, plucking fruit, prey of an animal, river, shooting stars, stone, streams, wave, wind, wood) are also numerous.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>5. If we consult D. J. N. Lee for <strong>comparison with Homer’s usage</strong>, we find that his list of “the subjects the simile covers” are actually vehicles (ninety-six), and these mostly animals: lions, cattle and birds showing the highest number of examples. Other vehicles from nature include the wind, waves, stars and rivers; there are some human examples (shepherds, fathers, women, hunters) and a few inanimate objects (lyre, auger, quiver, trumpet).<span class="noteref"> [<a href="#n-1">1</a>]<a id="noteref_n-1"></a> </span> As will be seen below, there is little over-lapping of vehicles in Homer and Plato.</p>

                                <h3>2. One word + adjective (very few examples):</h3>

                                <div class="Paragraph">“And <strong>like</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>) <em><strong>Creon </strong></em>in Euripides’ play when he sees Teiresias wearing his wreaths” <em>Alcibiades </em>2.5</div>

                                <div class="Paragraph">“<em>They</em> most valiantly answered his (Ctesippus’) questions … <strong>like</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>) <em><strong>boars </strong></em>(<em>kaproi</em>) when driven up to face the spears.” <em>Euthydemus</em> 13</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“<em>I</em> must rein in <em>my speech</em> <strong>like </strong><em><strong>a horse </strong></em>(<em>hoîonper hippon</em>) and not be carried away by it, <em>as though</em> <em><strong>it had no bridle in its mouth</strong><br />

                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>NB – Here the simile clarifies the metaphor: “rein in my speech”. Another example of this may be found at <em>Republic</em> 5.5: “Permit <em>me </em>(<em>me</em>) to <em>take a holiday</em> (<em>heortasai</em>—a metaphor) <strong>just as</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>) <em><strong>idle people </strong></em>are accustomed  <em><strong>to dine on </strong></em>(<em><strong>hestiâsthai</strong></em>) <em><strong>their own thoughts </strong></em>(a metaphor) when they walk alone.” At <em>Laws</em> 7.8, on the other hand, the simile introduces a metaphor: “<strong>Just as</strong> a <em><strong>shipwright </strong></em>at the commencement of a building outlines the shape of his vessel by laying down her keel, <strong>so</strong> <em>I</em> appear to be doing the <em>same thing</em>—trying to frame the shapes of lives according to the modes of their souls, and thus literally (<em>ontôs</em>) laying down their keels … to navigate our barque of life through this voyage of existence.” (803a)</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>4. Double (1 tenor + 2 vehicles):</h3>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>A <strong>few tenors</strong> are matched <strong>with two different vehicles, either in the same simile</strong>: <em>all things</em> flow <strong>like</strong><em> </em>(<em>hôsper</em>) <em><strong>leaky jars </strong></em>(<em>Cratylus</em> 8) or <strong>like</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>) <em><strong>people with a cold </strong></em>(<em>Cratylus</em> 9); <strong>or separately</strong>: knowledge (<em>epistêmê</em>) = a slave (<em>Protagoras</em> 19) or wild birds (<em>Theaetetus</em> 21). “<em>He </em>(<em>the sophist</em>) <strong>is</strong> a <em><strong>kind of juggler </strong></em>… an <em><strong>imitator of realities</strong></em>.” (<em>Sophist</em> 5) [the sophist = (both) a juggler and an imitator]</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>Thus there are more ‘vehicles’ than ‘tenors’ (roughly twice as many) because of the need for finding ever more images for the items that Plato wants us to visualize as well as the fact that some tenors (especially Socrates, the soul and <em>logos</em>) are used repeatedly. On the other hand, occasionally <strong>the same vehicle appears with different tenors</strong>: a ship’s rudder (<em>pêdalia</em> or <em>oiax</em>) is used as the vehicle for both ‘will power’ (<em>Cleitophon</em> 1) and ‘persuasion’ (<em>Critias</em> 3).</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>5. Proportional (two tenors and two vehicles: a &gt; b = c &gt; d):</h3>
                                <div class="Paragraph">Quite a few similes contain two vehicles corresponding to two tenors: “I/Socrates (a) am to Athens (b) as a gadfly (c) to a noble horse (d)” (<em>Apology</em> 3). Other examples are: “but he (Critias) seemed to have become as angry with him (Charmides) as a poet with an actor who delivers his verses badly” Socrates (<em>Charmides</em> 4); “their followers were to Dionysodorus and Euthydemus as a chorus is to its <em>didaskalos</em>” (<em>Euthydemus</em> 1); “You are to Bias as sculptors are to Daedalus” (<em>Hippias Major</em> 1); “Lacedaimonians are to you (Hippias) as children are to old women who tell stories” (<em>Hippias Major</em> 2); “poets bring songs as bees [bring honey]” (<em>Ion</em> 3); “we beg lawmakers as children beg a doctor” (<em>Laws</em> 4.5); “I/Socrates am bribed by a book as a hungry animal by fruit” (<em>Phaedrus</em> 3); “a lover is to his beloved as a wolf to a lamb” (<em>Phaedrus</em> 5); “leaders run from the Laws as boys from their father” (<em>Republic</em> 8.6). Most of these are attributed to Socrates. The following list (51) is fairly complete: <em>Alcibiades</em> 1.3, <em>Alcibiades</em> 2.4, <em>Apology</em> 3, <em>Charmides</em> 3, 4, and 5; <em>Critias</em> 2, <em>Crito</em> 3, <em>Euthydemus</em> 1, 13, 14, 15, and 16; <em>Euthyphro</em> 1 and 2; <em>Gorgias</em> 3 and 8; <em>Hippias Major</em> 1 and 2; <em>Ion</em> 3, <em>Laws</em> 4.5, <em>Laws</em> 5.2 and 10; <em>Laws</em> 7.9, <em>Laws</em> 9.1, <em>Laws</em> 10.8, <em>Phaedo</em> 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, and 20; <em>Phaedrus </em>3, 5, and 8; <em>Philebus</em> 11 and 13; <em>Protagoras</em> 5, 15, and 18; <em>Republic</em> 1.3, <em>Republic</em> 2.1, <em>Republic</em> 3.8 and 11; <em>Republic</em> 7.8, <em>Republic</em> 8.6, <em>Republic</em> 10.5, <em>Statesman</em> 4 and 21.</div>
                                <h3>6. Mechanical (‘inanimate’ vehicle for ‘animate’ tenor):</h3>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“The structure of the <em>spleen</em> is for the sake of the liver, to keep it bright and clean, <strong>as</strong> a <em><strong>wiper </strong></em>(<em>hoîon ekmageîon</em>) that is laid beside a mirror.” (72e) <em>Timaeus </em>15 [spleen = a wiper beside a mirror]</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“… and from these shapes of <em>marrow</em> (<em>muelon</em>) [i.e. the bones and marrow in the vertical column of the backbone), <strong>as</strong> from <em><strong>anchors</strong> </em> (<em>kathaper ex angkyrôn</em>), he cast out bands of the whole soul.” (73d) <em>Timaeus</em> 17 [marrow = anchors]</div>
                                <h3>7. Personified (‘animate’ vehicle for ‘inanimate’ tenor):</h3>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“[The <em>bile</em>] … forced through the veins into the lower region … <strong>like</strong> an <em><strong>exile </strong></em>(<em>hoîon phygas</em>) <em><strong>from a city in civil war</strong></em>.” (<em>Timaues</em> 31)[bile = an exile]</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“And in women too the so-called <em>matrix or womb</em>, a <em><strong>living creature </strong></em>(<em>zôion epithymêtikon</em>) longing to become pregnant … and wandering around everywhere inside the body, blocking up the breathing passages …” (<em>Timaeus</em> 34) [a woman’s womb = an animal wandering inside her body]</div>
                                <h3>8. Negative:</h3>
                                <div class="Paragraph">
                                    <p>Negative formulations support the didactic function of some similes by clarifying the terms and emphasizing the positive aspect, thus playing a role analogous perhaps to Socrates’ familiar practice of considering the opinions of his interlocutors only to reject them. This may be illustrated by several examples:</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“For this [praying for one’s own greatest evil] would be truly similar to some curse but NOT to a prayer.” -Alcibiades (<em>Alcibiades</em> 2.2) <span style="line-height: 1.5em">“This is NOT an art (</span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">technê</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em">) by which you speak well about </span>Homer … but a divine power (<em>theia dynamis</em>) which moves you, like [that] in the <span style="line-height: 1.5em">stone which Euripides called a Magnet …” -Socrates (</span><em style="line-height: 1.5em">Ion</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> 1)</span></div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“All these [five] parts of virtue are NOT like pieces of gold similar to (<em>homoia</em>) one another and to the whole of which they are parts, but like the parts of the face … dissimilar to each other.” -Socrates (<em>Protagoras </em>16)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">“[Socrates,] you spoke well when you said that <em>we</em> who belong to this ‘chorus’ are NOT the <em><strong>servants </strong></em>of our arguments, but <em>the </em><em>arguments</em> are <strong>like</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>) <em><strong>our servants</strong></em>.” (<em>Theaetetus</em> 12)</div>

                                    <p>Many references to literary authors and allusions to mythology may be found in the similes—most of them made by Socrates. Specific quotations are cited below in numbers 2, 6, 11, 12, 17, 25, 29. The complete list follows.</p>

                                    <p>References to painters or painting may be found in the following nine similes (and analogies) in the Compendium:</p>

                                <div class="Paragraph">1. “<strong>Just as <em>painters</em></strong> (<em>zôgraphoi</em>) … <strong>in just this way</strong> <em>we too</em> shall apply letters to things.” (424d) Socrates (<em>Cratylus</em> 7)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">2. “<strong>Suppose that a man should propose</strong> to paint a very beautiful creature (<em>zôon</em>) … that would never grow worse but always better; since the <em>painter</em> is mortal, unless he leaves a successor to repair and improve the painting, his toil will be short-lived.” (<em>Laws</em> 6, 769c) Athenian Visitor &#8211; An analogy, not a simile.</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">3. “The <em>Lawsgiver</em> (<em>nomothetês</em>) <strong>like</strong><em> </em>(<em>kathaper</em>) a<em> <strong>painter</strong></em> (or <strong><em>draughtsman</em></strong>, <em>zôgraphon</em>) must sketch (<em>hypographein</em>) the actions that follow the code.” (934c) Athenian Visitor (<em>Laws</em> 11.2)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">4. “It is divided into patches of various <em>colors</em> of which the colors which we see here may be regarded <strong>as</strong><em> </em><strong><em>samples</em></strong> (<em>hôsper</em> <em>deigmata</em>) which <em>painters</em> (<em>grapheîs</em>) use.” (110b) Socrates (<em>Phaedo</em> 17)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">5. “Which type of story (<em>mythos</em>) do you blame, Socrates?” (Adeimantos) “The kind you should blame first, especially if the lie is a pretty one (<em>mê kalôs speudêtai</em>) … <em>when one portrays badly</em> (<em>eikazêi tis kakôs</em>) <em>the true nature of the gods</em>, <strong>like</strong> a <em><strong>painter</strong> </em>(<em>graphôs</em>) <strong><em>whose portraits bear no resemblance to his models</em></strong>.” (377e) Socrates (<em>Republic</em> 2.6)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">6. In support of his claim that an ideal state might not exist, Socrates gives an analogy of a painter (<em>zôgraphos</em>), who portrays the pattern (<em>paradeigma</em>) of an ideally beautiful man but could not prove that he existed; would he then be any less good a painter?” (<em>Republic</em> 5, 472)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">7. “Do you think there is <strong>any difference</strong> between the <strong><em>blind</em></strong> (<em>typhlôn</em>) and <em>those who are truly deprived of knowledge</em> … and so cannot, <strong>like</strong><em> </em><strong><em>painters</em></strong> (<em>hôsper</em> <em>grapheîs</em>) fix their eyes on the absolute truth? (484c) Socrates (<em>Republic</em> 6.2)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">8. “The <em>person making a comparison</em> (<em>eikazonta</em>) must collect it from many sources … <strong>like</strong> <strong><em>painters</em></strong> (<em>grapheîs</em>) who combine goat-stags (<em>trag</em>&#8211;<em>elaphous</em>) and such [creatures]. (488b–e) Socrates (<em>Republic</em> 6.5)</div>
                                <div class="Paragraph">9. “We must use the blazonry (<em>poikiliai</em>) of the <em>heavens as patterns</em> (<em>paradeigmasi</em>) to aid in the study of those realities, <strong>just as</strong> one would do who chanced upon <strong><em>diagrams drawn by Daedalus</em></strong> or some other craftsman or <em>painter</em> (<em>dêmiourgoû ê grapheôs</em>).” (529d–e) Socrates (<em>Republic</em> 7.12)</div>

                                    <p>Comment: Painting is a visual equivalent of a simile or analogy since it can provide an illustration of something difficult to describe in words. Thus these examples all occur as <em>vehicles</em> of a comparison.</p>

                                <div class="Paragraph">5. “I see certain <em>speech-writers</em> (<em>logopoious</em>) who do not know how to use the special arguments (<em>tois idiois logois</em>) which they themselves have made, <strong>like</strong> (<em>hôsper</em>) <strong><em>lyre-makers</em></strong> [who cannot play] the lyres [which they made].” (289d) Cleinias (<em>Euthydemus</em> 9)</div>

                                <div class="Paragraph">8. “But <em>they</em> [Sophocles or Euripides] would not, I think, rebuke him harshly but [<em>they</em> would behave] <strong>as</strong> a<strong><em> musician</em></strong> (<em>mousikos</em>) would, if he met a man who thought he understood harmony because he could strike the highest and lowest notes.” (268d) Socrates (<em>Phaedrus</em> 27)</div>

                                <div class="Paragraph">10.
